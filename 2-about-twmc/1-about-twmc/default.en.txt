**The Tsukuba Walking and Mountaineering Club (TWMC)** is a club of Japanese and foreigners living in the Tsukuba-Tokyo area who like to go hiking and mountain walking. Founded in May 1998 TWMC has already visited many places in Japan like Fuji-san, the Japanese Alps and of course Tsukuba-san, to name but a few. Our aim is to provide walks at all levels to give everyone the chance to experience the natural beauty of Japan and of course to also leave no onsen untested!

There is no formal membership and consequently no regular membership fee, you automatically become a member by joining one of the club's hikes. To cover the cost of maps and club equipment we do, however, ask hike participants to pay a club fee of 300 yen for day trips and 500 yen for longer walks.

Browse through our pages for further club information and hiking advice, and to see where we have been, where we are going, and photos from various trips and events. Anyone can join the TWMC - either contact a TWMC committee member for more information or add your name to our mailing list, and if you live in or near Tsukuba, come along to our  (link: about-twmc/weekly-get-together text: Wednesday night get together ). We hope to see you soon!

Finally, it goes without saying that walking and mountaineering are not without risk, so please take the time to read our disclaimer and (link: about-twmc/guidelines text: club guidelines ).
