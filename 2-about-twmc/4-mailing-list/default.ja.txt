To ensure that every TWMC member receives the same information concerning club activities we have a mailing list.
We are using this service to announce details of walks and as a forum for discussions and questions related to mountaineering.

You can subscribe to our mailing list by sending a blank email to (email: twmc+subscribe@groups.io).
You will receive an email of request acknowledge from the mailing list service demanding a simple reply to confirm the subscription.
You will be then subscribed with the e-mail account you used to send that message.

Note that you do have to reply to the e-mail sent from the mailing list owners - this is a security feature which stops people adding other addresses to the mailing list.

To unsubscribe from the list, send a blank e-mail to: (email: twmc+unsubscribe@groups.io)

For e-mail users with multiple accounts: Be sure that you send this e-mail from the the same account to which your TWMC e-mails are sent.  The email-account given in the "sender" field of the e-mail sent  to (email: twmc+unsubscribe@groups.io) shall be deleted from the subscription list.

To post messages to the group (members only): (email: twmc@groups.io)

E-mail sent to this address will be sent to all subscribers of our mailing list.
If you have any problems or further questions, please e-mail the (email: ahenselmans@gmail.com text: club secretary).
