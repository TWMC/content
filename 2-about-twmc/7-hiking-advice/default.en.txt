Please read below to give you some ideas and advice on walking in Japan

**Hiking Preparation**

- Acquaint yourself with the area and its trails ahead of time so you can set a reasonable timetable. Many guidebooks give time estimates for trails.
- To save fuel and avoid the nuisance of shuttling cars, plan hikes that begin and end at the same parking area.
- Carry more water than you think you'll need, as much as you can comfortably carry. Fill your canteens before you leave.
- Backcountry water sources are unpredictable. Use of iodine tablets (or other suitable water purification systems) is advisable.
- Carry more food than you think you will need. It's better to take extra snacks home with you than to go hungry on the trail.
- Store your clothing and food in different colored sacks in your pack so you can find them easily. Put the items you need most frequently, such as your water bottle, guidebook or jacket, at the top of your pack.
- Weather on the trail can change quickly, especially in the mountains. Layer your garments, and be prepared for severe weather.
- If you are driving into remote regions, make sure your vehicle is in good running order and top off your gas tank.
- Start off slow to avoid fatigue partway through your hike. Take frequent breaks.
- Let the slowest member of your group set the pace. If skill levels are dramatically different, break into groups and meet at agreed-upon locations.
- To increase your chance of seeing wildlife, choose less traveled trails and start your hike early in the morning. (When you choose less traveled trails, you also help reduce erosion on overused ones.)
- Leave your itinerary with someone you trust, and check in with them when you return.
 

**Equipment for a one day trip**

- Walking Boots - A good pair of walking boots is very advisable. Trainers are not generally suitable. If your footwear is unsuitable then you may be asked to do a less dangerous walk.
- Trousers - We would prefer if you did NOT USE JEANS, for safety reasons as they get heavy when wet and can cause hypothermia.
- Rucksack - A small rucksack or bag big enough to hold spare clothing, food and drink, camera, waterproofs, safety gear e.g. a torch. Note that carrier bags are not suitable (but very useful for storing stuff inside a good rucksack).
- Waterproofs - A good water proof/wind proof top is essential for the hill walking. Waterproof trousers are also advisable.
- Gloves and hat - It is best if these are woollen and waterproof, remember it is much colder on the hill tops than you think.
- Clothing - Lots of thin layers are best to trap warm air, cotton is again not a good idea because it traps sweat. Fleece is warm and light.
- Food and Water - Onigiri, chocolate, dried fruit or other high energy foods.
- Money - For emergencies, restaurant and onsen afterwards!
 

**Comfort**

This section is termed comfort as opposed to safety. When stopped, put on an extra layer of warm/windproof clothing, as you get cold very rapidly. Also don't start the walk with all your clothing on - you will get hot quickly. Carry some reserve clothing for when it gets cold.
Eating carbohydrate foods beforehand is a good idea (pasta or potatoes for example). On the mountain eat a little, but often. Chocolate bars are a good source of energy, giving nibbles to accompany sandwiches etc. Dried fruit is also full of energy. Some extra food is needed as emergency rations in case you get delayed.
