We would like you to become aware of the safety issues while walking / mountaineering with TWMC, as all outdoor activities have some element of risk.

Following the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011, we became more aware of the danger of earthquakes and landslides and it is not possible to eliminate all risk. For this reason, we are requiring anyone joining our mountain walks to take out personal insurance inclusive of helicopter rescue we can suggest insurance schemes that we know about, but it is your responsibility to ensure that you are suitably covered.

Due to problems with legal requirements and responsibilities, it is essential that you agree that ALL RISKS ARE TAKEN BY THE INDIVIDUAL, NOT THE CLUB. We are always very happy to assist you in preparing for the risks involved during walking. In all cases, TWMC is here to attempt to help you have a great time in the outdoors, but we cannot be responsible for your safety - this responsibility can only be yours and yours alone. Please be sensible and use your common sense to maximize your safety during any trip.

Similarly, all equipment either owned by TWMC or other persons must be used at the individual person's own risk on club and/or private walks. Any equipment damaged or lost must be replaced in full or paid for in full to the owner(s).
