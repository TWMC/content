Title: About TWMC

Text: 

**The Tsukuba Walking and Mountaineering Club (TWMC) comprises Japanese and foreigners of all ages living in the Tsukuba and wider Kanto area who enjoy hiking, mountaineering, cycling, skiing, snowboarding, onsens, and other activities in the spectacular great outdoors of Japan. Founded in May 1998, TWMC has already visited many places in Japan like Fuji-san, the Japanese Alps, and of course Tsukuba-san, to name but a few. Our aim is to facilitate outdoor activities for participants of all levels to experience and appreciate the natural beauty of Japan and of course to also leave no onsen untested!

There is no formal membership and consequently no regular membership fee, but to cover the cost of maps and club equipment, we ask participants to pay small fees for participating in a TWMC trip. You automatically become a member by joining any of our activities. Browse through our pages for further club information and hiking advice, and to see where we have been, where we are going, and photos from various trips and events. 

If you are interested in joining the TWMC, then either contact a TWMC committee member for more information or add your name to our mailing list to receive email notices about TWMC activities. The official language of TWMC is English, but we welcome participants of all nationalities. Note that outdoor activities entail some risk, so please take the time to read our disclaimer and club guidelines. You are also invited to come along to our monthly Wednesday night get-together near Doho Park (usually the first Wednesday of each month; announced on the website homepage). We hope to see you soon!
