We would like you to become aware of the safety issues while walking / mountaineering with TWMC, as all outdoor activities have some element of risk. Following the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011, it is especially important to be aware of the currently heightened danger of aftershocks and landslides, as well as the risk of radioactive contamination as a result of the damage incurred by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor. Of course we shall not be going to Fukushima or Tohoku, and we are also avoiding the riskier high mountain walks, but it is not possible to eliminate all risk. For this reason, this year we are requiring anyone joining our mountain walks to take out **personal insurance inclusive of helicopter rescue** - we can suggest insurance schemes that we know about, but it is your responsibility to ensure that you are suitably covered. Due to problems with legal requirements and responsibilities, it is essential that you agree to sign the disclaimer of the TWMC that **ALL RISKS ARE TAKEN BY THE INDIVIDUAL NOT THE CLUB**. We will ask you to sign a document on your first walk with the TWMC (which also includes the date, address, full print of name, accident contact person, etc..) which states that you understand that you may encounter some risks while walking with the TWMC and that you shall try your best to be prepared for such circumstances. The text from this document is shown below.

 We are always very happy to assist you in preparing for the risks involved during walking. If you do not agree to sign the document, then please refrain from joining our activities until contacting and consulting a current committee member. In all cases, the TWMC is here to attempt to help you have a great time in the outdoors, but we cannot be responsible for your safety - this responsibility can only be yours and yours alone. Please be sensible and use your common sense to maximize your safety during any trip.

Similarly, all equipment either owned by the TWMC or other persons must be used at the individual persons own risk on club and/or private walks. Any equipment damaged or lost must be replaced in full or paid for in full to the owner(s).
