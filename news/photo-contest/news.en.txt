As is customary at the party, we will have a Photo Contest with small prizes for the winners. Please send your photos, which must be from this year's TWMC events, to Hamish (hamish.yeung@...) under the following three categories to enter:

*.A) People - any photo of people or relating to people. Could be TWMC members or not...
*.B) Nature - think mountains, flowers, animals, sunsets...
*.C) Fuji-san.

All, any and many photos are welcome, they really don't have to be professional quality. The main purpose is to share our memories of hiking over the last year, so please send any photos in!
