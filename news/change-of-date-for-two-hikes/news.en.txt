Summary: 

The weather does not seem to be very cooperative at the beginning of this year. 
The **Nokogiriyama hike** was scheduled on January 20th, but the weather forecast is bad. 
So the hike is **postponed to February 10th.**

The date for the **Akagi snow hike **has also been changed, there is not enough snow at the moment.
The new date is **Febuary 4th!**
