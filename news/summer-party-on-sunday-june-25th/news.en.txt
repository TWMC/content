Summary: 

Last week Nobu sent an invitation for the TWMC summer party.

<br>To brighten up the party we are thinking of doing some sing-along or other fun activities.
<br>So, 
<br>- if you have an instrument: bring it with you
<br>- if you know some nice dance or game: show and teach it
<br>- if you have any other idea: please do it!

Details for the party are on the activities page. 
Don't forget to bring your mosquito repellent (thanks David).
