Summary: 

Last week Nobu sent an invitation for the TWMC summer party.

<r>To brighten up the party we are thinking of doing some sing-along or other fun activities.
So, 
- if you have an instrument: bring it with you
- if you know some nice dance or game: show and teach it
- if you have any other idea: please do it!

Details for the party are below and don't forget to bring your mosquito repellent (thanks David).
