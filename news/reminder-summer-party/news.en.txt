Summary: 

We might have been afraid of possible rain for the TWMC summer party, but it seems that rainy season was very short this year and it is already over!
Instead the summer heat has come. 
<br>Luckily the weather forecast for next weekend is not as hot as the past days. So perfect to spend time under the trees at Yukari no mori. 
<br>Though it is a barbecue party, there will be enough food for vegetarians and non-meat eaters. 

<br><br><b>Please bring your own plate, cup and hashi so we can reduce (plastic) waste.</b>

<br><br>For people who want to <b>play tennis</b>: bring your tennis racket (if you have one) and wear tennis shoes. 

<br><br>The administration has asked us to provide a list with names etc. for Covid-reasons.
<br>See you all on Sunday July 3rd!
