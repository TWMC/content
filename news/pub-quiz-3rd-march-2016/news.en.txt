Dear Hikers and Friends,

Such was the success of the first TWMC Pub Quiz that we've decided to do it again!

Date: 2 Mar 2016 (Wed)
Time: 8:45-10:45pm (doors open 8pm)
Place: Hot Staff bar*
Format: 2-5 players per team, 5-6 rounds of questions, prizes for the winning and penultimate teams!
Fee: 100 per person, no registration necessary - just turn up!

For those of you that don't know or weren't there three weeks ago, a Pub Quiz involves answering questions about various topics in a team, and scoring points for each correct answer. In the end, the team with the most points wins. It's very informal (no experience or expertise necessary!) and it's a great chance to meet people and have fun together. No mobile phones, internet access or other devices are allowed, so it's a different way to challenge your mind...

Please bring your friends to form a team, or come alone and we will put people together. 

Hope to see you there!
