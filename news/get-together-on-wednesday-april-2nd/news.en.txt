Summary: 

It's been some time since we had a TWMC Wednesday meeting in HS. 

As Nathan and Anja will be leaving Japan and moving to the Netherlands on April 22nd (we will come back to Japan for visits of course), we would like to have a get-together in HS.

April 2nd is the first Wednesday of the month. **We will start at around 19:30 and Master san wants to close at 22:00. 
**
Hope to see you at HS!
