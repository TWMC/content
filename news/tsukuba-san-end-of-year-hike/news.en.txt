Summary: 

As you know TWMC canceled all its activities since April 2020 due to the corona pandemic. Most of you probably continued hiking by yourself during this long period, but it is also nice to meet and socialize with other people while hiking.    


It has been a long tradition in TWMC that the last hike of the year, the so-called end-of-year hike, is on Tsukuba san. 
In 2020 there was no end-of-year hike as the Covid19 situation in Japan was not too good.   


Looking at the situation in Japan and more specifically in Ibaraki at the moment, we think we can at least organize the end-of-year in 2021.  

Date: Sunday December 12th, 2021 (see activities for more details)
