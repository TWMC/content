Summary: 

The weather forecast for Narita April 15 and 16 is really not good. 
The chance of precipitation is 70-80%. Besides, the temperature will be rather low.
Sunday is not good as well, so I have decided to <b>cancel the trip</b>. 
As it was train based you can still go by yourself....

Unfortunately we will have to wait for another year to experience the taiko festival in Narita.
