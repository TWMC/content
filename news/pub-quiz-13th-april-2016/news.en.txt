Dear Hikers and Friends,

Time for another pub quiz and with Hamish away we have a change of quiz master...or rather masters. This time it is being organised by Helen and Steve. 

Date: 13 April 2016 (Wed)
Time: 8:45-10:45pm (doors open 8.30pm)
Place: Hot Staff bar*
Format: 2-5 players per team, 5-6 rounds of questions, prizes for the winning and penultimate teams!
Fee: 100 per person, no registration necessary - just turn up!

For those of you that don't know or weren't there for the previous ones, a Pub Quiz involves answering questions about various topics in a team, and scoring points for each correct answer. In the end, the team with the most points wins. It's very informal (no experience or expertise necessary!) and it's a great chance to meet people and have fun together. No mobile phones, internet access or other devices are allowed, so it's a different way to challenge your mind...

Please bring your friends to form a team, or come alone and we will put people together.
