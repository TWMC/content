Summary: 

Here is recent updates regarding TWMC activities. 
Unfortunately, the corona alert level in Ibaraki was raised from 1 to 2 last week and the number of infections are not small, especially in Tokyo.
TWMC committee members discussed about our future plan and decided to postpone the resumption of organizing events given the current situation.

We consider that we can start with cycling event or outside meeting according to the situation, although it seems to be  still difficult to hold car-based events.

Since personal activity is not very limited, I am happy to help you hiking.
If you need information regarding hiking area/route/hut/transportation, feel free to ask me.
There are many restrictions due to not only corona virus, but also rain, volcano, earthquake and landslideâ€¦.
For example, hiking route in Mt. Fuji is officially closed this year.
Anyway, the rain season will end soon!
