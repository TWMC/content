Hello Everyone!

The Sakura season is about to begin this year! While it lasts, let's have a pleasant easy walk. As announced in the schedule, I plan to organize one on April 9 (Saturday).

Let me begin by repeating that the family hike is an easy and leisurely hike for all abilities - with nice views! It is a real hike, yet light enough for all ages.Everyone is recommended to join this walk (you don't necessarily need to be married or have children). But people with children are encouraged to come, as well as with parents, in-laws or friends.

This time we will climb Amabiki-san (409m) from Amabiki temple (~150m). Amabiki temple dates back to 588AD, has a large compound where peacocks roam. We expect to see peacocks among Sakura blooms.

Where and when to meet: April 9 (Saturday) 8:30 AM at the Tsukuba station short time parking. This parking allows only up to 20 min. of free parking, so be there before 8:30 AM.

Plan: We arrive at Amabiki temple at about 9:30AM, look around and maybe have a coffee. Start walking at about 10:30AM. Have lunch at the top at about noon. Start walking down to the temple ~2 PM. Watch temple activities and ceremonies. Head back to Tsukuba between 4 and 5 PM.
We should be back to Tsukuba by 5:00PM in the afternoon.

Clothing according to weather, and rain protection (in case).
Walking or hiking shoes.

What to bring: a lunch box and drinks (water/ juice/ cha).

Fees: Children and drivers are exempt from club fee of 300 yen.

Transport: We will use car pooling. Let me know if you are coming by car.
