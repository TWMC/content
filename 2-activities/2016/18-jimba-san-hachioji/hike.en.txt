Description: 

Jimba-san (陣馬山) is located along the border of Hachiōji, Tokyo and Fujino, Kanagawa Prefecture and stands at around 857 meters. A big white horse stands on the top of the mountain. On a fine day the view of Fuji-san can be awesome, but at the end of April nothing can be promised.

The hike is train-based. We will leave Tsukuba station at around 6:10 am, take trains and bus and start hiking from Odarumi pass at 9:00. The route passes by Mt. Kobotoke-Shiroyama - Mt. Kagenobu - Mt. Dodokoro - Myoo Pass to Mt. Jimba. From Jimba-san we will walk to Fukugenji temple where we will take the bus to Takao station and from there back to Tsukuba.
