Description: 

The plan is to have 2 days of downhill skiing. This means that the trip is aimed at people who ski or want to learn how to ski. The destination will have slopes of various difficulty levels, allowing everyone to enjoy regardless of previous experience. You will also be free to set your own schedule, i.e. ski as much (or as little) as you want.
The accommodation is here: http://laforet-n.main.jp/

Report: 

After picking the rental car up and loading everything (and everyone) in, we departed Tsukuba around 9:00. We made good time and got to the hotel at a little past 12:00, including a short lunch break on the way. After changing and renting some gear, we were skiing by 13:00. We returned to the hotel to have dinner, thinking we'd get back for some night skiing. In reality everyone got lazy after eating, so we decided to have some drinks in the room instead. We woke up the following day to some light rain and feared the worst. However, the weather cleared by 10:00 and we were back on the slopes. We left the resort around 16:00 and headed for an onsen, before finally starting the drive back around 18:00. We were again lucky to avoid any traffic jams and were back in Tsukuba around 21:00. After stopping for some ramen, we returned home.

The trip turned out fine, despite our initial concerns about the weather. I would like to thank all the participants, especially Martin for doing the driving and Yumi for arranging the car rental. I look forward to seeing all of you on one of the future hikes.
