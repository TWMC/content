Description: 

Dear TWMC members
I am sorry but I would have to cancel this event. Two reasons: I have a potential schedule conflict on Sunday and there were delays in preparing the field for planting. It would be difficult for me to plan this event as mentioned, on May 21st, Sunday. 

I shall not be rescheduling the rice planting as TWMC event. However, to people who have already signed up/are planning to sign up and others interested in rice farming: 

Ginny and Nobue San have scheduled the rice planting in their respective fields on May 20th Saturday and I am planning to reschedule the planting to May 27th Saturday. If you are interested to join and depending on your schedule, please do get in touch with any of us . Or, If you are interested to start hobby rice farming next year at the foot of Hokyo San, do get in touch with any of us.

First Announcement: 
Important: This is not an hiking event, but an outdoor activity involving traditional rice farming.  
As a TWMC event, this event shall be organised on May 21st 2017. 

Some of the TWMC-members (Me, Ginny, Nobue San) enjoy growing rice in the fields at the foot of Hokyo san.  I am a newbie, in my second year as rice farmer, but Ginny and Nobue San are 'veterans' with a couple of years of experience in traditional rice farming.  Rice planting is usually an annual fun event bringing together family and friends to plant the rice saplings. This year we have decided to dedicate one of the day  of rice planting for TWMC event. 

The task on 21st , Sunday: The TWMC event planned for 21 st May 2017 Sunday is the fun bit of transplanting the rice saplings into the prepared field.  Three of the TWMC rice farmers would enjoy the help and support of the TWMC crowd in the rice planting. I have some photos from the last year of the rice field added here. 

You can come in Wellies, work clothes in which you would not mind getting dirty in the mud. This event promises a fun day out in the nature including getting your hands dirty in the mud.  The weather looks good for that weekend. We would wrap up the work around 4:00 pm and head to the Tsukuba Wellness Park onsen, followed by dinner together at a restaurant (to be decided). 

What to bring: 
Wellies
Hat (Important)
Gloves (if you have got)
Lunch + Snacks + Water
Onsen kit
Fresh clothes to change into after onsen

Cost:
Transportation costs

Meeting Place: Tsukuba Centre 8:00am

This would be a car based event. So car owners, please feel free to sign up. If you are interested to join on 21st  for the rice planting event, please do reply to this message with your name, number and car/no car details.  If you would require more details, please feel free to email me.

See you all next weekend.

Cheers
Deepa
