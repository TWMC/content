Description: 

END-OF-YEAR-PARTY
Yes, it's that time of year already! Time to hike up the steps to Hot Staff for the TWMC End-of-year Party!!

Date: December 9th (Saturday)*
Time: 19:00 - 22:00
Location: Hot Staff bar**

Everybody is welcome, bring your friends and family too! No need to register for this, but please bring some food to share. Note that drinks will be provided by Hot Staff, so please DON'T BRING DRINKS.

PHOTO CONTEST
As is customary at the party, we will have a Photo Contest with small prizes for the winners. Please send your photos, which must be from this year's TWMC events, to Ovidiu (ovcretzu@yahoo.com) under the following three categories to enter:

A) People - any photo of people or relating to people. Could be TWMC members or not...
B) Nature - think mountains, flowers, animals, sunsets...
C) Fuji-san.

All photos are welcome, they really don't have to be professional quality. The main purpose is to share our memories of hiking over the last year, so please send any photos in! However, please be aware that there is a limit of one picture per category.

So, in summary, come to the End-of-year Party and send in your Photos asap!

See you there,

Yumi & Ovidiu


Notes:
*It will be held on the same day as the end-of-year hike; please wait for the announcement in order to join that. There will be plenty of time between the two events to shower, change clothes etc.! But it's OK to attend one event and not the other too.
**It's the same place as we meet every Wednesday: http://twmc.club/about-twmc/weekly-get-together
