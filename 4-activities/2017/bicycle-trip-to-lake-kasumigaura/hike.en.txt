Description: 

Bicycle trip on the shore of Lake Kasumigaura on Saturday April 15th. 

1st update 
So far about 8 people have signed up for the bicycle trip. The weather forecast looks good, but if it is going to rain or if it is very windy, we will postpone the trip. I will decide on Friday and  send a final message after 5 pm.

Important information and changes: 
- We will be leaving earlier. Departure time is now set at 8:30, so meeting time is 8:20.
- 70 km is still a rather long distance, so if you are not used to cycling, please think about it.
- For people who live not close to Tsukuba center: If you do not want to come all the way to Tsukuba center, we can meet at the Kasumigaura lake at 9:30. See link for the meeting place.

Lake Kasumigaura is the second biggest lake in Japan. We will cycle from Tsukuba center over countries roads to the lake and then along the shore to the Kasumigaura Fureai Land. Kasumigaura Fureai Land is a theme park about water. There are a water science museum, an observatory tower, a ball museum and a water park. The observatory is about 50 m high. You can enjoy a 360 degrees panorama view with Mt. Fuji, Lake Kasumigaura, Mt. Tsukuba and the Kanto plain (if the weather permits). 

The round trip up and down from Tsukuba will be about 70 km. Most of the route is flat, but there might be some wind. 
If we have time we can visit the Kasumigaura historical museum and the Ayumizaki-kannon temple on the way. 

The meeting point will be next to the Tsukuba center koban (opposite the bus terminal).

What to bring
Bicycle
Rain gear
Water
Lunch (can also be bought on the way)
Snacks to share

If you want to ride with us, please send an e-mail with your name and your phone number.

Report: 

In all 14 people had signed up for this trip, seven people met at the koban in Tsukuba center at 8:20. We waited some time as one person couldn’t be reached (it later turned out she had written that she would come to the second meeting point), so we left at around 8:45. 

As announced in the final message the wind was quite fierce, but blowing from south-west so we had a very pleasant and smooth ride through the beautiful countryside of Ibaraki. In Tsuchiura there were still many sakura trees in flower along the river with petals floating on the water.

On the way we got a message that two people coming from Kannondai were lost and were trying to find the second meeting point near the Kawaguchi sport park. We waited some time for them, sent messages, tried to reach them by phone, but to no avail. We also learned that 3 people were not joining anymore, so at around 10 am a group of nine headed to the Kasumigaura shore road. 

Most of the time we had the wind pushing us in the back and at 11:30 we arrived at Kasumigaura Fureai Land. We had lunch, climbed the tower and in spite of not too clear weather the view was great. Two people were a bit in a hurry and headed back.
At 13:30 we set off to go back by the same route, but now against the wind, which was not only fierce but really very very strong. After about 4 km we walked up to the Kasumigaura Historical Museum. It is situated on a pretty location and worth a visit (we didn’t have time though). On the way down there are some old houses and a teahouse.

We continued our strenuous ride, fighting against the wind, it was really hard. The group had split into two and at km 16 (from Tsuchiura) the second group decided to leave the shore and take a road more inland. The sky was getting very dark and thunder and lightning were starting. I went on to find the first group and luckily they were waiting at a crossroad not too far and we also went inland. It was really too dangerous to stay on the lake shore with our bicycles and the ongoing lightning. 

When it started to rain, we took shelter and while waiting the others arrived so we were united again. After the rain the wind seemed to subside and we got back on our bicycles. However, we got split again into two groups. The first group continued along the quite pretty road with many old houses and stopped at a renkon (lotus root) shop to buy some. The second group decided to take the shore road again as it was slightly shorter. But that turned out to be a wrong decision.
Suddenly it started to rain again and this time it was ‘real’ rain, pouring and pouring and there was no shelter whatsoever on the shore. While the others were enjoying coffee in the renkon shop…..

After the rain the sun came out and we were able to reunite again in Tsuchiura where we said goodbye to two participants and the others had a pleasant ride back to Tsukuba center where we arrived at around 17:30. 

It was a fun day with lots of ‘weather’ excitement. We had cycled exactly 70 km.

Thanks to all the participants for coping with the circumstances...
