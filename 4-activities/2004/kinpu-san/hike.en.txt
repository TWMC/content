Description: 

Report by Sveta 
:I'm glad to say that all 12 hikers came back from the Kinpu-san hike almost safe and sound :-)
I want to say extremely BIG THANKS to all 3 drivers Nicolas, Akira and Mark for their cooperation and car-support.
 
We met at 5 am at 7/11, but we started moving in the direction of the starting point of the hike only at 5:30. Akira with the hikers in his car went first to get another hiker from Tokyo. 
 
We started hiking 1 hour later than was planed and soon split into 3 groups: Super fast hikers, Map time hikers and Enjoying views hikers. The forest was really nice with the trees looking like if they were growing from the stones and rocky ridges were extraordinarily beautiful. 
 
There were many nice views on the way and lucky hikers could even see Fuji-san appearing from time to time from the clouds.
 
The fast group reached the top 40 minutes faster than the map time. And after taking group pictures on a big rock on the top Super fast hikers went back anticipating an Onsen after the hike.
 
Map time hikers waited for Enjoying views hikers on the top and after taking pictures also went back the same way as they came.
 There was a difficult rocky part before the top, which could add 1 more star to this hike.  Congratulations to everybody who join this hike and conquered the Kinpu-san for the first time in TWMC history.
 
While Super fast hikers were enjoying onsen the mixed group of Map time hikers and Enjoying views hikers was continuing their way back and they reached a car well after dark around 9 pm.
 
We gathered all together in the parking and started our way back to Tsukuba. On the way back we stopped in a service area to get some snacks and from there 3 cars went back separately.
 
I hope that though the hike was difficult it was still enjoyable for everybody. The cost of the hike was more 	than expected because of the high way toll:
Joban 1300
Tokyo 700
Chuo 600 + 2850 
 Thanks to everybody who joined the Kinpu-san hike.
