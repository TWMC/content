Description: 

<b>The hike on September 29th is cancelled</b> due to rapid deteriorating weather in combination with typhoon approach. 
Weather forecast Saturday around Ozaku-san area is 80%  rain probability and it could be worse as the typhoon is coming close. 
This is the first time for me to have two cancellation of the same hike in a year. Bad luck.....

Maybe it will be rescheduled next Spring.. if the timing is good...


//TWMC day-hike organized by Toshi, September 29th. //

Destination: Ozaku-San 
Height: 879.4m
Location: Tochigi-ken, Kanuma-city
Date: 9/29(Saturday)

Meeting point: Tsukuba TX station car park
Time: 6:30am
Transportation: car 

This is the car-basis trip to Ozaku-San. 
My car allows maximum 4 participants to have a ride, preferably 3 people excluding the driver, me! 
I appreciate very much if any participant could join with a car if participants are more than 4 people. 
The sub-leader is Kumiko-san who could bring her car to the shortage of car-transportation (kumiko-San! Yoroshiku!!).

The schedule:
6:30(Tsukuba) —-> (zyoban line)—>(Higashi-kanto line)—> Toga Exit —>route177–>route240–> Kaso-San shrine ( the driving time would be around 2h).

Kaso-San shrine —> one of local onsen —>motorway ( which route we are taking is dependent on which route is less crowed ...) 

—> Tsukuba ( Target time is 20:00..)

Brief information regarding this mountain:
Kaso-San shrine which is laid as the gateway to Ozaku-San was opened up by Syo-do holly priest who pioneered the Nikko shrine in 782. 
The route to the summit is formed with steep ascend with many chains and metal ladders along the mixture of trees and rocks. But, it is not the same as Myogi-San in terms of difficulty level ( easier than M...).
The one of the peaks called Tsuki-Yama is the best spot, where you can see the nice figures of several peaks of Nikko mountains ( Nantai, Oku-shirane....).

@@The difficulty level  ## 3/5 ##

The time to complete the route ( with return) is roughly estimated around 4h. 
There are some pics on the way to the top as below.

Regarding the weather factor, the hike will be cancelled in case it is getting wet. The sloppy rocks and wet metal ladders are nothing but very slippery element for this hike. Unfortunately alternative date this June is not available. I hope I could reschedule the day-hike this October in that case....

What to bring and what to put on:
Good boats 
Cool clothes ( like T shirts)
Rain gear
Lunch 
Water 
Gloves ( to handle metal chains ......if you need.)
Onsen stuff 
 
Send the information below if you want to participate in this hike.
(1) your name
(2) availability of your car< yes or no>
(3) the place to meet up ( except for those who can come to Tsukuba centre. )
