Report: 

Kentoku-san was a fun but challenging hike. This is the report of the one-day hike. The report of the two-day hike is in another activity.

Participants: 5 (one day), 3 (two days)
Transportation: Car (almost no traffic jams)
  Outward: Tukuba-chuo(Keno-do) – Hanazono(Kanetsu-do) – Chichibu – Oodaira (Kentoku-san)
   Return: Oodaira (Kentoku-san) (Katsunua(Chuo-do) – Shuto Highway – Sakura-Tsuchiura (Joban-do)

We left Tsukuba center around 5:10am on the 14th. To avoid traffic jams, we chose the route going through Chichibu and had two small breaks on the way. We started walking from Oodaira car parking around 9:20. It wasn’t too hot but humid. We sweated a lot. Actually I had cramps twice. I should have drunk more water. The embarrassing thing for me was that I had to ask a stranger who were just walking behind me to massage my leg… I could ask Thierry to do it in the second time. Thanks Thierry! I learnt it is important to drink and take some salt for avoiding this. The courses were quite interesting and bit adventure. We saw some deer around Tsukimi rock. There are some places we needed to climb the rocks using chains. It took 3.5hours to get to the top from the car parking. We had lunch there and then went down. After 10 min walk down, 2-days group left for Kurogane-san direction to continue their walk and left of us went down to the hutte direction. Our course was quite steep and slippery. So it made us exhausted. But we could see many deer again near the hutte. Finally we got back to the car parking at 17:00. It was bit late than I expected but the starting time was also 1 hour delayed. We stopped at onsen, had dinner and back to Tsukuba around 22:30. There was no traffic jams on the highway.
