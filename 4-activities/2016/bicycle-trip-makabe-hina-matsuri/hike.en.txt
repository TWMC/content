Description: 

Hello everybody,

On 27. February (Saturday) we are organizing a bicycle trip to visit the Hina-Matsuri (Doll Festival) in Makabe. The most interesting read about the Matsuri you can find on TsukuBlog:

We will cycle along from Tsukuba Center up to Makabe along the RinRin bicycle road. For the festival lots of decorative dolls are on display, some of them impressively old. We will look around the dolls
and local shops and find some snacks and food to eat (there is also a local sake brewery for tasting). On our way back, we are planning to stop at Wellness in north of Tsukuba to take a bath, so bring your Onsen kit.

Date: 27. February 2016
Start: 8.30am, Central Park at Tsukuba Center, next
to the police box
Distance: 30 km one way
Return to Tsukuba: ~19 o`clock
What to bring: Onsen Kit, drink, appropriate clothes not to get
too cold / too hot when cycling, club fee 300 Yen

If you want to join, please let me know your name, cell phone number and what kind of bike (fast or slow).

Any bicycle can join, including Mama-chari. In case bicycle type and speed is very different, we will form two groups: fast and normal.

Besides the bicycle road (longest section), we will be riding on normal road, so take care of your own safety. Make sure you have lights on your bicycle because after Onsen it might get dark depending on our timing.

Hope to see you on the trip!
