Description: 

Dear TWMC members,

It is a bit early but I would like to announce the annual TWMC party. 
Usually we have BBQ party but this year. We are international club. Let's have a traditional costume party this time!
Sounds exciting, right??? Please check your wardrobe. Probably you have a traditional costume from your country in it.
If not... Actually it is not limited to the costume from your country. If you want to wear something else, it is fine.
Maybe it is time to try kimono ;-) Anyway, we welcome all the members, your families and friends whatever you and they
wear.
It is going to be a potluck party. So, please bring one dish with you and do not forget to bring your own plates and
chopsticks for being eco-friendly. TWMC will provide some drinks. 
The details are as follows;

Date: Jun 26, Sun
Time: 11:30-15:30 (clean up by 16:00)
Venue: Sakura Minkaen (Japanese old house)
2-7-5 Azuma, Tsukuba (in the chuo park, near the rocket)

We still have time, please find out your costume!
Hope to see you at the party.

Report: Fortunately the weather was fine on Sunday, Jun 26. Many members and friends were showed up in their nice costumes. Actually SAKURA minka-en, the traditional Japanese house in the central park is the nice place to have this kind of gathering. There are enough tables, benches, spaces even for changing clothes. We had a relaxed time of chatting, having meal, taking photos and so on. Thank you very much to the participants for your company. It became a nice party.
