Report: 

We leave the Tsukuba station parking lot at 16:00 and arrived at the Tsutsujigaoka (つつじヶ丘) ropeway station before sunset.
We walked on the Otatsuishi course (おたつ石コース).
The weather was much better than my expectation.
On the way, we enjoyed taking pictures in the dark and . Also amusing rocks were fun.

We waled faster than the previous year and arrived at the summit.
The view from there was so amazing and stars were beautiful.

Then we went to the restaurant and had food.
Unfortunately, three of us stayed at the summit after others leave and they took a ropeway by mistake.
After dinner, we took a ropeway and  drove back to the tsukuba station.

Although this event was just a short hiking, it was great fun.

Note that the "stardust cruising” ropeway operation is only available during winter.
