Description: 

This is the first announcement for the Narita Taiko Matsuri, a large Japanese drumming festival which is being held on Saturday, April 18.

The festivities begin at 10am at the Naritasan Shinshoji Temple with "Play for Peace - Sengan Hana Daiko."  This performance showcases all of the groups that will be performing throughout the day and concludes with a powerful performance of nearly 800 taiko drums.  We'll then take a short walk through some scenic woods behind the temple. At that point we can have lunch and watch performances at numerous stages around the temple.  We'll be able to walk up and down the road seeing many taiko shows at a number of stages.  The main show will be a night drum concert beginning at 5pm at the temple.

We'll want to arrive at the temple around 9am to ensure that we can get a good spot to watch the initial event at 10am.  For those of us in Tsukuba, starting from Arakawaoki station on the Joban line will get us to Narita the fastest and the cheapest.  Here is the tentative time schedule:

0655 Meet at Arakawaoki station
0713 Train to Narita
0833 Arrive at Narita & meet with anyone coming directly to Narita
0845 Walk to the temple

Please let me know if you'd like to join or if you have any questions!  

For those joining, please also let me know (a) if you need help getting from Tsukuba center to Awakawaoki or (b) if you can assist in providing transportation from Tsukuba center to Awakawaoki.
