Caption: The main part of the celebration: the Nikko walk. Five years ago, the TWMC started its program of activities with a walk in Nikko, climbing Shirane-san on the first day, and doing a valley walk between Yumoto and Ryuuzu-no-taki on the second. Three people, Archana, Kouichi, and Paul, who were on that first walk, participated this year.
