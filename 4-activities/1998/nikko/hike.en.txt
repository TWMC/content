Description: 

Following intense discussion at the meeting last night, the following three
routes are suggested for the walk in Nikko on Sunday 6th September:

(1) Yumoto onsen -> Lake Kirikomiko-Karikomiko 2-3 hrs
This is the walk suggested by Rick. It's supposed to be easy and also quite
pretty. Recommended for families and very unfit/tired hikers.

(2) Yumoto onsen -> Lake Kirikomiko-Karikomiko -> Sanno Pass -> Kotoku
onsen -> Yudaki falls -> Yumoto onsen 5-6 hrs
A loop including the previous walk, as well as Sanno Pass, some walking along
a river (Sakagawa), possibly making a small detour via Senjoo-ga-hara (a
swampy area), and along Lake Yunoko. Some people commented that this walk
might be too easy. So you can either put rocks in your backpack to make for
harder work, as suggested by someone, or try the third alternative.

(3) Kotoku onsen -> Taroo-san -> Kotoku onsen 6-6:30 hrs
A mountain walk with nice views of Nantai-san, the marsh, and Shirane-san
from the top of Taroo-san.

It is planned to drive to the start of the walk(s), which should take at
least 4 hrs. Therefore it will have to be an early Sunday morning I am
afraid, leaving Tsukuba between 5 and 6 am...

So people who are interested in doing any of the walks, please email me
before next Wednesday. Let me know which walk you are more interested
in doing, and whether you can drive (with your car or sharing the driving
with someone).
