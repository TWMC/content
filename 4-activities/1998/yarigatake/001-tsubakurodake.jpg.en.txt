Caption: Tsubakurodake - Tsubakurodake is about 3 and a half hours from Hodaka. It's where we rested our already weary bodies during lunch of the first day. It was so nice lying in the sun there that we slept for half an hour, waiting to get sun-burnt... From Tsubakurodake to the foreground of the image one can see the ridge where we spent a good part of the walk to Yarigatake
