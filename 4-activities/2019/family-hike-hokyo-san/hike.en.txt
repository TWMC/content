Description: 

As you already know, Family hike is a hike for all abilities! Everyone is recommended to join this walk. You don't necessarily need to come with a family member. But people with children are encouraged to come, as well as with parents, in-laws or friends.

Hokyo-san is nice for a family hike especially because of its proximity and moderate height. It is closer from here than Tsukuba-san, and less than half its height. This year we will take the 'Course 1' route, which has a gentle slope. We will start from the pond, then walk through farms, and up through the forest. We will have lunch at the top.

Where and when to meet: April 14 (Sunday) 8:30 AM at the Tsukuba station short time parking. This parking allows only up to 20 min. of free parking, so be in time.
We should be back by 16:00 in the afternoon.

Clothing according to weather, and rain protection (in case).
Walking or hiking shoes.
What to bring: a lunch box and drinks (water/ juice/ cha).

Fees: Children and drivers are exempt from club fee of 300 yen.

Let me know if you are coming by car.

Inform anyone else who may be interested, especially with children.
