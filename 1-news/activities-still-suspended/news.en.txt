Summary: 

Unfortunately, the corona alert level in Ibaraki was raised from 1 to 2 early July and the number of infections are still rising, especially in Tokyo.
TWMC committee members discussed about our future plan and decided to postpone the resumption of organizing events given the current situation.

We consider that we can start with cycling events or outside meetings depending on the situation, although it seems to be  still difficult to hold car-based events.

Since personal activities are not restricted, the club is happy to help you go hiking.
If you need information regarding hiking area/route/hut/transportation, feel free to ask.
There are many restrictions not only due to the corona virus, but also due to rain, volcanos, earthquakes and landslides....
For example, the hiking routes on Mt. Fuji are officially closed this year.
Anyway, the rainy season will hopefully end soon!
