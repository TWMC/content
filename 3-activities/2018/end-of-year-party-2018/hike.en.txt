Description: 

It's time for the end-of-year party!  Like every year we will have an end-of-year  hike to Tsukuba-san and the party in Hot Stuff in the evening.

The hike  will be organized by Anja  (she sent announcement with details to the TWMC mailing list and details are also below )

As for the party, everybody is welcome, even those who did not  join any hikes. Come and join us with your friends and/or family.  It's a great to meet friends and have a fun :).

The party is potluck, please bring something to share with others. 
However, please do not bring your own drinks, these will be provided by Hot Stuff (500 yen each). 

We will have the photo competition 2018 as usual and might be something to have some fun as well!  We don't have any category for the photo competition  this year  so you can submit any TWMC related  pictures.  You can send the photos to me (kuu71machita@gmail.com) / Miko (kuma8smile-mm@yahoo.co.jp).
Deadline for submitting is December  6th, Sorry for this short notice!   
The winner will get a small gift and will not have to pay the club fee for all next year's hikes!
