TWMC’s  hike  –乾徳山  (Kentoku-san),  2031  m  July  14th (1-day  main  plan)  and  July  14th-15th  2018  (extended  2-day  plan)  

One  of  the  Japan  200  Famous  Mountains  (日本二百名山,  Nihon  Nihyaku-meizan):  http://yosniimura.net/yama/Japan200Mountains.html 
Several  reports  about  hikes  at  kentoku-san  are  available:  https://climbjapan.blogspot.com/2014/07/running-and-scrambling-on-mt-kentoku.html http://ridgelineimages.com/hiking/mt-kentoku/ 

Main  plan: 1-day  hike,  starting  from  Odaira  (parking  place,  now  a  huge  photovoltaic  power  station  under  construction),  ascending  the  south  face  of  Kentoku-san  (chains)  via  the  emergency  hut  (deer  area),  descending  its  North  face  (ladders)  and  completing  the  tour  through  the  forest  via  the  emergency  hut  again  to  Odaira. 

2-day  extended  plan:    Wakako,  Floris,  Thierry  
Day  1:  same  route  as  the  1-day  hike  accompanying  the  5  other  hikers  to  the  top  of  Kentoku-san.  Ascent  of  its  south  face  with  ropes  and  chains.  No  need  for  either  ropes  or  chains  if  you  feel  confident  with  trees  and  rocks.  Descent  of  the  north  face  with  ladders  and  split  in  two  group  (5  hikers  back  to  the  parking  for  1-day  hike,  pink  route  on  the  map;  3  hikers  for  the  2-day  tour). 
Hike  on  the  woody  ridge  from  Kentoku-san  to  Kurokane-yama  (黒金山)  with  alternation  of  ascents  /  descents,  gentle  slope  all  way  long  (no  water  point).  Top  of  Kurokane-yama  (~2200  m)  Not  very  spectacular  (cloudy  at  that  time)  Possible  to  see  国師ケ岳  through  the  clouds. Descent  to  a  cross-road  called  “大ダオ”. The  map  seems  quite  inaccurate  for  this  part  of  the  trail,  with  an  alleged  map  time  at  30  min  while  1 hour  is  needed  (in  accordance  with  panels  onsite).  End  of  hike  at  ~6  pm. 
 
大ダオ  is  a  pass-like  and  flat  area  at  ~2000  m  clear  of  trees  (forest  fire?  fungal  disease?)  making  it  ideal  for  bivouac.  Full  of  flies  though,  a  little  camp  fire  helps  keeping  them  away  (dead  trees  around  to  feed  the  fire).  Many  deer  walking  around  at  night  (unseen,  only  heard  from  tents).  
大ダオ  also  offers  a  nice  view  on  Kentoku-san  and  potentially  Fuji-san  in  clear  weather  (the  summit  was  barely  visible  in  the  morning)  with  an  unobstructed  view  southward.  Pretty  bad  choice  for  sunrise  and/or  sunset  though  with  two  peaks  eastwards  and  westwards.  Water  point  ~20  min  downhill,  steep  trail. 

Day  2:  Descent  from大ダオ  (start  at  ~  7  am)  to  the  valley  following  several  streams  merging  into  one  main  river  徳和川  (dashed  trail  on  the  map,  trail  is  indicated  with  pink  ribbons).  徳和渓谷:  beautiful  ~1 km  long  loop  trail  along  two  rivers  with  several  waterfalls  –  not  indicated  on  the  map.  Fresh  water  seems  to  be  totally  drinkable  (as  for  me,  no  problem  so  far  in  spite  of  drinking  ~2L  of  it  at  different  spots  from  spring  to  main  river).  
Multitude  of  dams  on  the  way  down  getting  closer  to三富徳和  village,  offering  as  many  pools  and  potential  campsites.  Ascent  of  Kentoku-san  once  more  via  another  route  (乾徳山登山口)  to  reach  the  emergency  hut  (cf.  1-day  report,  Nobu-san)  at  ~  1 pm.  

At  least  3  “official”  water  points  on  the  way  up  (Ļ  last  one  near  the  hut). Long  lunch  break  and  nap  time  near  the  hut,  arriving  at  the  parking  lot  at  ~4  pm...  right  before  a  thunderstorm  !  Onsen,  dinner  and  back  to  Tsukuba  (~  9:30  pm)
