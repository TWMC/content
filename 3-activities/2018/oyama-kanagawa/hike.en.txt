Description: 

The weather looks great for Sunday. Don't hesitate to sign up !

This is the announcement for the Mt. Oyama hike on Sunday, May 27th (NOT Saturday, as was initially planned). According to the local tourism board, "Mt. Oyama stands 1,252m high, and is located nearly in the center of Kanagawa Prefecture, within verdant Tanzawa-Oyama Quasi-National Park. Mt. Oyama has been an object of worship since ancient times, and during the Edo period journeying up the mountain became popular with the general populace.".

Out of several possible routes, we will be following the "Nature and view point trail". Detailed information can be found here: http://www.isehara-kanko.com/files/lib/1/84/201711161159454432.pdf . 
The expected course time is 5-6 hours, including all stops and breaks. The difficulty level is 2 out of 5.

This will be a train-based hike. The departure time is ~6:30 from Tsukuba station. We will take a bus from Isehara station around 9:00 and start hiking around 10:00. (I don't think this is easily doable by car, but if you are stubborn enough to drive let me know.)
 
*What to bring:
Hiking/trekking shoes
Lunch (you can buy food at the base and top of the mountain)
Drinks

*Expected Cost:
Transportation: about 6000 yen round-trip
Club fee: 300 yen
