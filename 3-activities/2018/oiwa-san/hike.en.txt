When we have enough time and energy, let's try to climb 623m Mt.Takasuzu, it is just next to Mt.Oiwa.

What to bring:
- Rain gear: (whether forecast says there is possibility to rain)
- Hiking shoes for low mountain: ( *NO! converse shoes!!* at least walking shoes or sports shoes, there is slippery and rocky place on the mountain trail.)
- Water and snacks for 3 hours hike.
- Camera if you want.
- Lunch ( in case you are vegetarian or don't like to eat seafood at fish market, I recommend to bring your own lunch.)
- Onsen kit (face towel, underwear, soap and shampoo if you like)
	
When you don't like to take public bath, you can enjoy ocean view at there. Please bring book or something to relax.
