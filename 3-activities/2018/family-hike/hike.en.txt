Description: 

First of all, the weather outlook is good, even very warm!

My original message with information is below. Let me know if you have any questions.
I will make another update on Thursday.

Description of the hike
To remind you, Family hike is a hike for all abilities, all ages! Everyone is recommended to join this walk. You don't necessarily need to come with a family member. But people with children are encouraged to come, as well as with parents, in-laws and friends.

Hokyo-san is nice for a family hike especially because of its proximity and moderate height. It is closer from here than Tsukuba-san, and less than half its height. This time we will take the Gokurakuji course (極楽寺コース), whose approach is from from the other side than what we take every year. It is leads smooth but more interesting, and equally comfortable.
 .
Where and when to meet: April 22 (Sunday) 8:00 AM at the Tsukuba station short time parking. This parking allows only up to 20 min. of free parking, so be on time.

We should be back by 15:00h in the afternoon.

Clothing according to weather, and rain protection (in case). 
Walking or hiking shoes.

What to bring: a lunch/brunch/snack box and drinks (water/ juice/ cha).

Fees: Children and drivers are exempt from club fee of 300 yen.

Let me know if you are coming by car. (We want to have enough number of cars, but also a minimum number for all participants, to find parking spaces).

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!
Inform anyone else who may be interested, especially with children.

In case of bad weather, I will try to organise again in the following weekend.
Waiting to hear from you,

Report: 

On an unusually hot day for this season, we went on the annual Family Hike to Mt. Hokyo-san (~400 m). There were some 29 participants by the latest estimates, including 8 children (aged 4-10) 
This time we took route the Gokurakuji course (極楽寺コース) for going up, (it is supposed that have waterfalls). It was very pleasant, with a few challenges. On suggestion of Kotaro, we came back by Oda castle course (小田城コース). This was a very nice walk through a green forest, with bird chirps. 

We started from the rest house 宝 篋 山 小 田 休 憩 所, next to which there is a parking, but we could not find parking space there even at 8:15 AM. So we parked at the big parking nearby in the Oda village this parking was only about 25% filled. We ended our hike at the same rest house.

Four cars went directly to the starting point; two more started from Tsukuba Center; the last arriving at the parking by 8:40. We used the rest rooms at the rest house, and started walking at ~9:00. The start of the walk was led by the youngest, 4 years old! We arrived at the top by ~11:00 (after using bio-toilets just before the peak).  We gathered in groups at various benches and had lengthy conversations. The children were hyperactive again as soon as their stomachs were filled! 

Before leaving we had customary group pictures with the backdrop of Tsukuba-san (after competing for the spot with groups of elderly hikers) and waiting for various from our group to come together, and then began our decent (~12:30). We took the diversion to the rest house near the end of the trail. Children were still full of energy. We arrived at the rest house at ~14:45h.

I want to thank Aki for organising the families and taking care of their needs. I thank Kotaro for invaluable help with keeping track of members at both ends of our line on the trail.
