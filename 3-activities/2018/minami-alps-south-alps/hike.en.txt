Description: 

<b>Unfortunately this hike was cancelled because of the typhoon.</b>

It was found that the 9 P.M. is too early for meeting time.
Plus, taking a nap in a car is not comfortable and  let me change the meeting time at Tsukuba station parking lot.

It takes 3.5 hours from Tsukuba to Ashiyasu bus station. The bus/taxi operation starts at 5:15 and we are supposed to make a preparation and walk a little bit from parking lot to the bus station before that.
This means that we can leave Tsukuba at 0:30 A.M.
However, after midnight, transportation to Tsukuba station might be limited.

So, please tell me if you cannot come to Tsukuba at 0:30 A.M. or you need to wait for a long time at Tsukuba station.

Once you take a car, you can take a nap until we arrive.

Best regards,
Kotaro

Kita-dake hike on 27 (night) - 29th, July.

Kita-dake (3193 m, Mt. Kita, 北岳) is the mountain of south alps  and the second highest mountain in Japan.
Four years ago, we climbed this mountain led by Julian.
However, unfortunately, only one-third of participants could reach at the summit due to bad weather.

Again, I'd like to organize a same hike!
The plan is based on the previous hike schedule.

*SCHEDULE
27th (Friday night) 
9:00 p.m. Depart Tsukuba center parking lot for Ashiyasu (芦安) bus station.
To take a bus to the start point, we will stay in our car until morning.
Tent might be available, but in principle there are no space for tent.

28th (Saturday)
We will take a bus or taxi at 5:15 a.m. to Hirogawara (広河原) gate and then start to walk to the hut.
The map time is 7 hours.

29th (Sunday)
We will leave the hut for the summit (1h) , and walk back to Hirogawara to take a bus to get back to the parking lot.
After the hike, we will stop at onsen and drive back to Tsukuba.
The map time is 6.5 hours.

*Difficulty level:  4 out of 5.
The route is not technical, but long. The difference in altitude between start point and summit is 1600m!
At the hut, camping space is also available. If you want to camp there, you need to bring tent, sleeping bag, mat, cooking stuff and so on.
