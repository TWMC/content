Description: 

Let's go to Mt. Hokyo, our favorite for family hikes.

During this time of the year the weather is a bit unstable (rains), and so, depending on our luck, we may have to shift the date a bit.

To remind you: this hike is open for all ages and abilities. People with kids are especially welcome. You can write to me anytime for any consultation. And you can invite friends.

Schedule: Let's plan to start from the Tsukuba station temporary (drop-off - pick-up) parking (free for 20 min.) by 9:30 PM. (try to arrive here by 9:20)

Hike starting point: Let's take the Hiking Course 1, starting from the pond (Hojo Oike). This is the most comfortable hiking course. See the map here:

The Parking will be the Taikan physical activities center (point S in map above).
We will use the toilets here before setting off for walking.

Families coming in cars, who will not join in the car pooling, can come directly to this parking by 10:00 AM (confirm the plan with me in advance). We plan to gather in the parking by 10 AM to start walking.

It will take about 90 min. (up to 120 min.) to walk to the top. There are mountain toilets at the top.

We will have lunch (please bring with you) at the top, relax, take in the scenery, and then walk back.

Covid measures: Covid etiquettes and manners are now well established, and we are all expected to behave accordingly. When walking apart from each other we can remove our masks, but keep them on when walking close each other. 

Let me know if you are interested in joining, and if you a car and can give a ride, or if you need a ride. 

Alok
