Description: 

As winter approaches, I am pleased to announce a pleasant late morning walk in Shishitsuka, a small region just east of Tsukuba, inside Tsuchiura. The region has a lake and a pond, and hosts Kamikotsu Kaizuka Hometown History Plaza and Tsuchiura City Archaeological Museum. This walk is more or less on a planar ground (does not involve any climbing).

We will start from Tsukuba center in car pools, as usual, and drive  some 5 km to the parking lot of the Archaeological Museum [there is also an option to come there on bicycles], park our cars there and start walking. After walking for about 2 hours we will have our lunch, walk some more and head toward the parking lot of the museum. Those of us interested can visit the museum (entry free). 

Meeting place: Tsukuba Center prop off/pick up parking of the station [free for 20 min.], as usual.

Departure time: 9:30 AM (please do not be late, because we can park only for 20 min.) on 27th November (Sunday)

What to bring: lunch! drinks

What to wear: casual clothes, light walking shoes are fine.

Finishing time: by 2 PM.

So please let me know if you want to join, are coming by car (and how many participants can you take with you), or want to come on bicycle.

Let's hope for a good weather,

In Shishitsuka, Tsuchiura City, there is a 100-hectare satoyama area surrounded by a reservoir and a forest of mixed trees. It is the widest satoyama from Tokyo to the foot of Mt. Tsukuba. The surrounding area is also rich in historical sites such as the Shishitsuka Burial Mounds and the nationally designated Kamikotsu Shell Mounds. 

<br>Since its establishment in 1989, the Shishitsuka Nature and History Association has continued to carry out activities to hand over this precious satoyama to the younger generations.
