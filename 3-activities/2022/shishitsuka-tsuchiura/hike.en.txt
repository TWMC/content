Description: 

In Shishitsuka, Tsuchiura City there is a 100-hectare satoyama area surrounded by a reservoir and a forest of mixed trees. It is the widest satoyama from Tokyo to the foot of Mt. Tsukuba. The surrounding area is also rich in historical sites such as the Shishitsuka Burial Mounds and the nationally designated Kamikotsu Shell Mounds. 

<br>Since its establishment in 1989, the Shishitsuka Nature and History Association has continued to carry out activities to hand over this precious satoyama to the younger generations.
