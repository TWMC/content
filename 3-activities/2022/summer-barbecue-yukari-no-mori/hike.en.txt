Description: 

Rainy season is not fun for hiking so we have a summer BBQ party instead.

Everybody is welcome! Even if you have never been on a hike, please come and join. It is a great chance to get to know people, hear about exciting hikes and club activities, and enjoy good times with BBQ together. 
Participation is free and TWMC will provide food and non-alcoholic drinks. If you want you can bring a (home-made) dish or (alcoholic) drinks to share.

It might be cloudy and even rainy. Bring an umbrella to be sure. Part of the BBQs are under a roof.

We will be there from 10 o'clock and start preparing, if you want to help please come. 
Like making fire? food? turning some sausages? We need some volunteers to help take care of the bbqs.
