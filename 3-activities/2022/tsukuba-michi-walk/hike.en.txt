Description: 

The Tsukuba Michi road was created in 1626 by order of 3rd Tokugawa Shogun Iemitsu. The road starts from Hojo town and leads to Tsukuba shrine. The Tsukuba Sanroku Autumn Festival is currently being held along the road, providing a good opportunity to discover the charms of the village at the foot of Mt. Tsukuba.
