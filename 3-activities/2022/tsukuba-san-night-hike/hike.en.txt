Description: 

<b>'Stardust' night hike on Tsukuba san on Saturday December 10th.</b>

Hiking Tsukuba in the dark is a different experience that you shouldn't miss. Full moon will be on December 8th, so the moon will still be beautiful if the sky is clear. The view from the top of the mountain is gorgeous, enjoy 'Stardust over Tsukuba'.

During autumn/winter season, the 'stardust cruising ropeway' is available.
<b>If the ropeway works, we go back by ropeway, but it depends on the weather. So be prepared to walk down, just in case.</b>

After sunset, which is around 16:30, we will start hiking from the Tsutsujigaoka (つつじヶ丘) ropeway station and climb to the Nyotai summit (female peak, 女体山).
We will enjoy the night view from the mountain, have a small 'party' at the viewing deck and take a ropeway back to the car parking lot.
So, one way hike and one way ropeway ride!
Please bring a head/hand lamp and warm clothes, it can be windy and pretty chilly at the peak.

The restaurant is open until the last ropeway. 

Difficulty level: 2 out of 5.

<b>Meeting time and place : 16:00 at car parking next to the Tsukuba center bus terminal.</b>
