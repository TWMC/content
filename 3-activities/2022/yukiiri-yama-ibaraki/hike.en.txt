Report: 

Twelve people, including toddler Hotaka, gathered around 9:30 at the Tsukuba bus terminal parking lot. We left around 9:40 and started hiking at 9:25. There is a big parking lot at Yukiiri Fureai no Sato Park and there is a nature center, which we did not visit. 
<br>In spite of the weather forecast being quite good, we had a drizzle and sometimes slight rain almost all along the way. It made some parts of the trails quite slippery, but we still had nice views over the Kanto plain and Kasumigaura.
<br>At 12:00 we arrived at Kengamine, which has benches and a nice view, so a good place for having lunch.
At some point there were many trails so the way down was a bit confusing. Just follow the signs to Mitsuishi. There is a restaurant and toilets. When people were enjoying the view the kind lady even offered some autumn snacks. 
<br>We arrived back at the parking lot at 15:00 and arrived in Tsukuba around 15:45.
Thanks everybody for joining and see you at the next hike or other event. Share your pictures!
