Mt. Adatara is located in Fukushima and one of Japan's famous 100 mountains. Adatara range is made up of some volcanoes and the last eruption was in 1996. You can see a crater during the walk.

The weather was nice and the autumn leaves were lovely. We enjoyed our hike a lot.

Day-1
We met at the Tsukuba station car parking, left there 7:05am and arrived at the car parking of the Adatara kogen ski resort around 10:10. Though I had been worried about finding a spot in the car parking, actually it was easy. Since the ropeway wasn't operating in
the morning due to strong winds, probably many tourists gave up going up and left. 
We started walking at 10:30 from the car parking, arrived at Yakushi-dake at 12:00. Everybody enjoyed watching a beautiful shape of nipple of Adatara-yama from there. After 30 min of lunch break we headed to Adatara-yama. On the way to get there, we had nice views and the autumn leaves which was very colorful and cute. It was around 14:00 when we got to the summit. It was so windy and hard to walk around even for standing. Especially Ushinose area, the winds were really strong and 4 ladies had to give up to continue walking to Tetsuzan. Only Thierry could get there. It took 45 min from Ushinose to Kurogane hut. We arrived there around 15:30. The onsen was nice. We went to bed around 19:00.

Day-2
We had breakfast at 5:30 am and left the hut around 6:45. It was cloudy when we left the hut but the weather improved while we were walking. We walked along the shizen-yuho-do. The pass was lovely. We got back to the car parking around 8:45. We decided to go to
Jododaira which is located on Bandai-Azuma skyline road and it took about 45 min to get there by car. We had a break for second breakfast and coffee there. After that we walked around Azuma-kofuji crater for one hour and also walked to Okenuma pond. Autumn
leaves were very beautiful there. And we saw long line of cars when we left Jododaira around 13:00. We were so lucky that we could reach there early. We stopped at a public onsen at Takayu, had a lunch break on the highway and got back to Tsukuba around 18:15.
