There was still space to park on the time at Ryugasaki, time schedule was no problem.
At tsukumai performance place, we could get good space to look at it, but I should have announced the place to every participant.
Their performance was really thrilling because they did without any rope besides the weather was windy.

There was on another street parallel to performance street, we enjoyed food and drinks and looked at carrying Omikoshi people.
Compared to Tsukumai street, this street was so crowed.
After having enough food. we went back to Tsukuba safely.^^
