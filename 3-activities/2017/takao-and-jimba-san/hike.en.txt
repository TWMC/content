Report: 

The event was organized as a train based hike. Seven of us met at Takaosanguchi station at 9:30.

We chose the Inari-yama trail to our first summit, Takaosan (599m), which took about 1.5h.  It was warm and nice but we could not enjoy the view of Mt. Fuji.  Two of us left the group to go sightseeing.  After a short break, we continued to Mt. Shiro (670m), where we had our lunch around 12.  The overall trail was nice and easy.  By the time we arrived in Mt. Kagenobu (727.3), it started to be misty.  It was still 1:40 so we decided to go forward to Mt. Jinba (855m).  The trail was flat with very small ups and downs.  The route was on the border of Kanagawa prefecture and Tokyo so we often crossed the two borders during this one hour.  At 3:50 we reached the summit of Mt. Jinba and enjoyed the warm food at the mountain hut.  Around 4:20 we made our way to our bus stop and took the 5:25 bus.  Overall, this was a very relaxing hike with all four summits having nice restaurants and clean bathrooms.  For anyone who wishes to climb these mountains, the reverse route starting from Jinba is recommended.  With this, you can avoid the tourists at Mt. Takao in the morning, and also have more options after reaching Mt. Takao in the afternoon.

Thank you for joining the hike.  Especially, thank you for your guidance, Andreas.
