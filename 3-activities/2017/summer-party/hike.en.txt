Description: 

Time for the TWMC summer party.
Because July is rainy season it is not a good time to go hiking. But getting together with friends and have some food and drinks is always a pleasure.

As we liked the party last year we decided to have it again at the old house in Tsukuba Chuo Koen and ask you to wear a traditional costume or other special outfit. 
Check your wardrobe, maybe you have a traditional costume or item from your country in it.
And for foreigners, maybe it is time to try kimono ;-) 
Anyway, we welcome all members, families and friends whatever you and they wear.

It is going to be a potluck party. So, please bring one dish with you and do not forget to bring your own plates and chopsticks for being eco-friendly. TWMC will provide some drinks. 

The details are as follows:

Date: July 8, Saturday
Time: 11:30-15:30 (clean up by 16:00)
Venue: Sakura Minkaen (Japanese old house)
2-7-5 Azuma, Tsukuba (in the Chuo Park, near the rocket)

Hope to see you at the party.
