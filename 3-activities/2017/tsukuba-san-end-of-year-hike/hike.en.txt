Description: 

It's time for our traditional year-end hike up Tsukuba-san!

This time I chose Kangori car parking* for our starting point. We start walking from there along the Tsukuba-Michi to get to the Tsukuba-san shrine, then head to the summit of Nyotai-san, female peak of Tsukuba-san.

This will be a car-based, so I hope enough car-owners will join.

*Kangori car parking (つくば市神郡1070番地1)

Meeting place: short-term car park at the bus station in Tsukuba Centre
Time: 9:00 am
Total walking time (without lunch): approx 4.5 hours
Return time: hopefully back in Tsukuba by 4:00 pm at the latest (to have enough time to get ready for the party)
No membership fee

What to bring:
Walking boots
Rain gear, warm clothing and gloves
Water and snacks
Money (to buy lunch on the summit - or bring your own lunch)

Please let me know by Dec 4 if you would like to join, and if you can provide a car.

Report: 

This is the report for the end-of-year hike to Tsukuba-san.

We left Tsukuba center around 9:15… I was bit late. The others were on time, I guess. I decided to park our cars at the torii of 6-chome instead of the Kangori car parking. We started walking from there around 9:50 and headed to the Tsukuba-san shrine through Tsukuba-michi. From there, we took Shirakumobashi course. First half was pretty steep and needed to have some stops. After this part, we enjoyed watching some stone statues and shapes. However there were some snow on the trail. So it was quite slippery, especially around the Nyotai-san (female peak). We walked very carefully and it took more time than usual. Finally we had lunch at one of restaurants on the top around 13:30 and left there at 14:20. Three of us took ropeway to avoid the slippery trail. Rest of us went down along the cable car path. There were almost no snow on that side. We got back to the shrine around 15:30, the car parking around 16:20, and the Tsukuba center around 16:50. It was a nice hike.
