Description: 

Family hike is a hike for all abilities! Everyone is recommended to join this walk. You don't necessarily need to come with a family member. But people with children are encouraged to come, as well as with parents, in-laws or friends.

Hokyo-san is nice for a family hike especially because of its proximity and moderate height. It is closer from here than Tsukuba-san, and less than half its height. We will visit castle ruins first, then walk through farms, and then up through the forest.

Where and when to meet: April 23 (Sunday) 8:30 AM at the Tsukuba station short time parking. This parking allows only up to 20 min. of free parking, so be in time.

We should be back by 16:00 in the afternoon.

Clothing according to weather, and rain protection (in case).
Walking or hiking shoes.

What to bring: a lunch box and drinks (water/ juice/ cha).

Fees: Children and drivers are exempt from club fee of 300 yen.

Let me know if you are coming by car.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!

Inform anyone else who may be interested, especially with children.

In case of bad weather, I may postpone to the next month.

Report: 

I am pleased to report that we had a wonderful family hike on a very fine day last Sunday, April 23. There were 42 of us, including 11 children, with 9 cars. We parked in the public parking in Hirasawa, quite near the pond, which can accommodate upto 66 cars. It was quite empty. We walked to the ancient ruins site nearby, and spent some time there, and then started walking (at about 10:20h), taking the hiking course 1. One car had got lost while driving from Tsukuba, but they were able to find the beginning of the trail and sent us a message that they have already started walking.

By the time we reached the scheduled stop for lunch, it was still about 25 min. to noon. So we decided to go ahead to the peak, where we arrived just at noon, and had a leisurely lunch, talking and looking at the panoramic view. 

We started walking down at about 13:30 h, and were back to the parking at about 15:00h.

I thank all the participants for joining and to make it fun, and all the drivers to transporting us. I thank Aki for coordinating with all the mothers and taking care.
