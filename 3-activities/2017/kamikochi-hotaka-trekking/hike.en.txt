Report: 

Hotaka trekking report

We left at 19:30 on 14th at Tsukuba station for Matsumoto.
We arrived in Sawando parking area at 1am and took a nap until the morning. 

Sat 15th
We started walking at 7:30 to Myojin. sunny day, we were able to see the peaks of Hotaka from Kappa bashi.
8:30@ Myojin
9:30@ Tokuo; everyone enjoyed soft cream! 
10:30@ Yokoo
12:45 Hontani bridge. people took a long rest before the steep hill and enjoyed cold river water.
14:40 After S gare, we see Karasawa hutte, but the trail was completely covered by snow. We had to walk carefully on the snow...
15:30 Finally we reached to the Hutte. it took much longer because of snow trail.
Tent users had to build their tent on snow...looks very cold....
Mountain ash is flowering around the Hutte. some other highland plants were also blooming. 

Sun 16th
The weather forecast said it will be rain/fog from 11am.
Some other parties started to pass next to Karasawagoya towards to saitengrat before 5 am...
After discussion, Route A people decided not to climb up the summit of Okuhotaka. so we enjoyed a long breakfast.
9:00 We started to walk down to Yokoo. Snow stairs were made by the hutte people. 
It made us easier to walk down the hill! Cedric was super fast to go down snow hill...he was almost running down the hill!
11:30 We arrived at Hontanibashi. it was good pace to walk..
12:20 We had lunch and checked in Yokoo sanso. 
After lunch, some of us decided to go to Yarimi dai. but when we arrived at Yarimidai, it started raining...heavey rain! 
so we could not see Yarigatake after all. We quickly went down to the hut. 
Lucky that we were able to check in the hut before heavy rain.
Four girls made 90 min walk to Tokuzawa to get soft cream under rain... the rest of people enjoyed onsen before dinner.

Mon 17th
The rain had stopped...!
7:20 we started to walk to Tokuzawa. 
8:00 we enjoyed the second soft cream!
9:00 crossed the bridge and walked the other side of the river at Myojin. 
We dropped by Myojin ponds and kept walking till Kappabashi.
We saw a monkey on the way! getting sunnier and more tourists.
11:30 we arrived at Kappabashi. had early lunch with a reward of another softcream!
12:40 we took a taxi to go down to Sawando parking area. Enjoyed onsen!
after drying a tent, we took a highway to Tsukuba.
23:45 arrived late at Tsukuba center because of traffic jam.

I hope everyone enjoyed the hiking!
There was still a lot of snow around the Hutte compared to the last year, so it was a bit hard to walk but everyone returned safely.
We saw a rescue team brought an injured man in Yokoo sanso at 20 pm. 
It is not safe to walk down under heavy rain...we made the right decision! 

Here is some photos from the hiking. Enjoy!

In addition, I would like to share the link to live camera at Japan Alps area.
it would be useful to check autumn leaves and snow condition before planning a hiking.
