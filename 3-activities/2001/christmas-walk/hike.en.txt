Report: 

So, there really IS an interesting
path up to Tsukuba-san! We went towards the plum-garden from the
parking, then after a few hundred meters turned right up the bed
of a small river, following something that may or may not have
been a path. We met a real path at some point, which led us further
up, but more "left", until we met a branch where we
followed a rocky river bed all the way up to Nantai-san. The rest
was the "standard route".
