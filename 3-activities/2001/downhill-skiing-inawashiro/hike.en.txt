Description: Adriaan snowboarding. Unfortunately he 
      refused to release the photo Björn took 
      of him falling.



      Björn skiing. Unfortunately nobody took 
      a picture of his famous fall on the easiest 
      part of the easiest slope (see below).




 
      Safety is more than just a word for lifts 
      in Japan. This one even has a steel tube 
      you can hold on to.



      MRI scan of Björns right shoulder. The big 
      white blob in the middle is the upper arm 
      bone where it joins the shoulder. You can see 
      the chunk that broke off. 
      The other notable thing is the back-translation 
      of Björns name from Katakana into Romaji 
      (Klotz Björn became Kurotutu Biyorun).
