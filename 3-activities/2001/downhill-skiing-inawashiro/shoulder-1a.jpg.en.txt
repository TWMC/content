Caption: MRI scan of Björns right shoulder. The big        white blob in the middle is the upper arm        bone where it joins the shoulder. You can see        the chunk that broke off.        The other notable thing is the back-translation  of Björns name from Katakana into Romaji        (Klotz Björn became Kurotutu Biyorun).
