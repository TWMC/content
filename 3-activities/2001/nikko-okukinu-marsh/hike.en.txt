      Terry's translation of this sign:
      The bear is disappointed with the 
      mountain climbers who make the 
      mountains dirty. Please "bear" in mind 
      that we should take empty cans and 
      trash back home and be conscientious.





      The "fluffy" crocodile.




Â 
      "Fluffy" wigs.
