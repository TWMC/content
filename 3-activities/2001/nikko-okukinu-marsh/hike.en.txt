      Terry's translation of this sign:
      The bear is disappointed with the 
      mountain climbers who make the 
      mountains dirty. Please "bear" in mind 
      that we should take empty cans and 
      trash back home and be conscientious.





      The "fluffy" crocodile.




 
      "Fluffy" wigs.

Report: 

A trip to Nikko [my, Iulias, point of view]
Motto: "Fluffy and laughing make any situation enjoyable".
The weather forecast for the rainy season cannot be good. But Terry said "rain or shine" and a simple member of the club cannot argue with his president. 
Anyway, Saturday morning is was "shine" and 9 people gathered around three cars near 7/11. A "heart breaking" decision for Shinji was taken, we would drive with two cars and the GPS equipped, silver sports [looking] car would stay in Tsukuba. Well, we had some road atlases, maps, a smaller GPS and Terry's confidence that we will find the way. Apparently in the other car (Mario's) the confidence was not entirely shared: when Terry drove first toward the AIST (to let Shinji's car in the AIST parking), Mario drove in the opposite direction, toward Mt. Tsukuba. Afraid of an open mutiny, the people in his car forced him to stop and wait for Terry. 
Reunited we reached Nikko, passed Nikko and entered the famous windy road leading to Chuzenji lake. Well, even concentrating on saying the poem related to this road, Shinji did not feel comfortable about "sitting in the car" and not "driving the car". I was really thankful I didn't have to drive. The scenery was beautiful; Sun was still with us, we had plenty of time... Dropped out near the Ryuzunotaki (waterfall) we spent the time in which Terry and Mario drove off to leave one car at the end point of the first day's walk by taking pictures (very nice waterfall, funny participants and a new star was born: Fluffy) and supporting the Japanese economy with omiyage shopping. Elena and I checked out the geta; unfortunately they were suitable for the delicate Japanese feet only.
Half an hour later we were on the way toward Senzyogahara marsh. Some more water falls, nice water games around spectacular boulders in the river, some naked, some covered with fluffy green moss. The walk went through a beautiful forest along the river, with bamboo grass and dead tree trunks resembling to fantastic creatures. The image of a couple sitting and doing aquarelles of the landscape reminded me the impressionists and the strong influence the Japanese paintings had... Well, this is another story. 
Strolling we did not pay attention to the real world and woke up on the opposite river bank but near the starting point of our walk. I don't know about the others but I enjoyed walking that small part twice, prolonging the sentiment of silence and beauty. The marsh itself was a little bit more populated with tourists ­ I think there was a kind of contest ­ and for a while we were busy "konichiwa"- "hi"- and "byebye"-ing.
Japanese children are dangerous! Dangerously attractive I mean. For Angie, coming from Brazil and encountering a lot of "premieres": 1st time with the TWMC, 1st time around Nikko, this was the first time when she noticed the danger, but too late. Thus, it was also the first time she twisted her left ankle.
I think that the first day we shot a lot of pictures, of marsh with fog, dried roots, strange fluffy wigs and a crocodile. Why? Don't you believe this? Look at the pictures.
