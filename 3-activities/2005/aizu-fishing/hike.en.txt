 Well Drasta and myself had a wonderful time with about 8 other happy campers with the Japanese Fly Fishing Association on their first sojourn into being professional fly fishing guides. I am sure we were an interestinggroup for them to practice on as were all total beginners! I had been wanting to fly fish for some time now was very pleased when Ajay and Ryoko announced this trip to Minami Aizu in Fukushima prefecture.
 
Before our first session of fly fishing we made camp, then geared up- in huge waders. We began the lesson in a relatively wide river near a bridge where we practiced the beginning basics of how to tie surgeons and clinchknots, how to wade a stream and how to cast. There were many instructors so that most of us received individual attention I was initially a bit intimidated by my silent instructor but he turned out to be a gem and was extremely patient and full of love for the art of fly fishing (I hardly dare call it a sport). We were given a demonstration of Japanese style fly fishing also which evolved concurrently but independently of the European style. 3 fish were caught that day in total!
 
That night we spent at the camp site with a great BBQ and a Daal made by Ajay provided. There was also some impromptu fish education with Yamame (lady in the mountain) and Iwana ( rock fish ) photos shown. The next morning, after a night of heavy rain ,we started out late but it was still a very fulfilling  morning of fly fishing and wading up  a very beautiful stream. Our guide also cut some plants form the side of the river which we ate - Udo- which he said was also very good for tempura. He also dug form rocks on the river bed and showed us various stages of insect life. I became very aware of the insect life around me and their different colors and shapes. As the day progressed and the sun began to shine a myriad of colors reflected on the waters surface and though I did not see the elusive Yamame I could imagine its beauty lying somewhere not too far away.
 
In the feedback session the casting of fly fishing was compared to the actions of sumie. I too became aware of something refined in this experience so that my natural Australian love and at-homeness with nature was somehowtransformed into a feeling of  unity!  This was truly yet another highlight in my time here in Japan that the love and care of TWMC has again given me.
Thank you.!
