Photos and Report by Alok
I am happy to report that the first family walk of the club has been successful enough for us to think of organizing some more. Although families have always been encouraged to join our walks, we organized this one especially to encourage children and their parents to join, so that the children can learn to appreciate and enjoy nature. The study of nature actually bordered on academic by introduction of Sumi-e art to the walk. Participants, including children, studied plants and flowers closely to draw them.
We were 19 adults and 7 children (aged 2 to 11) (8 families). All this not counting the one still unborn, and not counting Ginny and Tadashi who gave a brief appearance.
The weather forecast was a little worrying with chances of rain in the afternoon, but we were lucky and there was in fact more than two hours of diffused sunshine, after threatening clouds which gathered at about noon. Everyone made it without difficulty. Children were the most active. A 5-year old was heard complaining to his father that he was just walking, while he had been promised a hike!
We climbed from the northern side (with gentler slopes) and climbed down on the south which has choice of many trails. We had parked cars at both ends. Sakura trees in bloom dotted the hillsides. We stopped at Expo memorial near the top for lunch and Sumi-e. Everyone tried and enjoyed the art.
I thank Ryoko and Ajay for the idea of introducing Sumi-e and conducting it. And I thank all the participants for joining to make this trip enjoyable and worthwhile.
