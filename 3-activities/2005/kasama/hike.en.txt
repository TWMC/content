Report by Masako, (no photos)

I am happy to report that we came back from Kasama with joyful (and sleepy?) mood. 20 people and 7 cars appeared to the meeting place, so we had enough seats for everyone at the end. All the participants completed the hike happily (actually it was more than 20 people if we include the unborn baby in its tough and cheerful mother ;)
Surprisingly, many kinds of flowers were blooming. We saw cherry, azalea, pear, lily, katakuri! etc. We also encountered many animals such as tadpoles, snakes, lizards! Weather kept smiling all the time. We could enjoy both walk and nap comfortably under blue sky, and could contribute bending machines at the end of the hike by buying a lot of cold drinks.
I am not sure if all the participants enjoyed Kasama pottery fair as well as we did with the hike. We could spend only one hour which was not enough to examine all the stalls.  Some three snowcone lovers could not even manage to visit the site at all.  Well, I hope the trip served its introductory role of Kasama pottery to the most of the new comers at least.
Although we are quite a big group consisted of variety of members, people were so cooperative and friendly, making everything smooth. I thank all the participants for crating such an enjoyable trip, and drivers for making the trip possible. Special thanks goes to Ryoko who suggested me such a nice destination and helping me all the leading work!!!
