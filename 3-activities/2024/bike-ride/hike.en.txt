Description: 

Come join me for an approximately 45 km cycling loop tour on Saturday morning 20 April. Meet at the Tsukuba Center bus station at 9:00 am for a 9:10 departure. We will ride mainly on small rural roads, but there will be some short stretches on roads with traffic. There will be some small hills but most of the route is pretty flat. There might be some short unpaved sections. We’ll ride at whatever pace is comfortable for the slowest participant and won’t leave anyone behind.

 

If persistent or moderate to heavy rain seems very likely, the tour will be postponed by email sent Friday evening, 19 April. Be sure that your bicycle is in good working order and your tires have appropriate air pressure. Because brains are soft and helmets are hard, helmets are strongly recommended. There will be a convenience store break along the way, but bring water. We should be back by early afternoon. To sign up, email to rickweisburd@gmail.com with your name and keitai number.

 

TWMC charges a 300 yen fee from adult participants (children are free) for day trips, which I will collect. Cycling entails some risk of accidents and injuries for which TWMC and I take no responsibility.
