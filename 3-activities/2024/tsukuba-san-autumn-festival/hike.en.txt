Description: 

The Tsukuba san autumn festival is held every year at the foot of Tsukuba san. 

It is related to the Ozagawari-sai festival. In spring and autumn, a parent and child deity switch their altars between the main shrine at the summit and the worship hall halfway up the mountain in a Shinto ritual to pray for a good harvest. This event is held on November 1st, unfortunately on a Friday.

We will go on November 2nd as there will be plenty of activities on that day too.
