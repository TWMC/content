Description: 

This is the first announcement of Hiwada-san hiking. Hiwada-san is located in Saitama prefecture. It takes about 2 hours from Tsukuba by car. 

Hiwada-san is not so High Mountain (305.1m). It is located behind Kinchakuda in Hannno City. There are many varieties of courses and magnificent view from Kotohira shrine on the top.

We might also see autumn leaves. Please be careful of Otokozaka, it is a little bit steep. It is particularly popular among the mountains of Saitama prefecture, and is visited by many hikers throughout the year.

The walking time is around 90 min from the bottom. There are benches on the trail and toilets. I think it is good for beginners.
