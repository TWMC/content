Description: 

This is the first announcement of Hiwada-san hiking. Hiwada-san is located in Saitama prefecture. It takes about 2 hours from Tsukuba by car. Map

 

Hiwada-san is not so High Mountain (305.1m). It is located behind kinchakuda in Hannno City. There are many varieties of courses and magnificent view from Kotohira shrine on the top.

It might also see changed leaves. Please be Careful of Otokozaka is a little bit steep. It is particularly popular among the mountains of Saitama prefecture, and is visited

by many hikers throughout the year.

The waking time is around 90 min from the bottom. There are bench on the trail and toilets. I think good for beginner.
