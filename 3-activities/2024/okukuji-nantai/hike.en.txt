Description: 

First announcement for Mt. Okakuji Nantai hiking om Nov.16 (Sat) 2024. This mountain, about 650 m high, is in Daigo town, in the North of Ibaraki. It is well known for Fukuroda waterfalls. Daigo town is well known for its fall colors. We expect to experience some of it, at least.

Plan: We will set out at 6:30 AM from the usual Tsukuba Center parking and arrive at parking (elevation about 250 m) of the hiking by 8:30 AM. It will take about 2 hours of walking to the peak. We will have lunch at the peak, taking in the panoramic scenary of the hills below. We will then move on to Chofuku temple with a beautiful garden (~1:15 h). After spending some time there we will walk down to our parking (~1:30 min.) along the panorama route road (~1:00 h).

After getting into our cars again, we will visit the Fukuroda waterfalls, and back.

What to wear: good hiking boots and wintery clothes are recommended.

What to bring: lunch box and drinks. Onsen kit in case we decide to go to one on the way back.

Transportation: this is a car based hike. One way distance is about  100 km. We will use Joban expressway for the first 60 km, until Naka IC.

Please let me know if you would like to join, if you have a car and how many passengers can it carry. Include your mobile number as well.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
