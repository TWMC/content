Among the first hikes this year is to Nokogiriyama in Chiba, along the Tokyo Bay coast and a view of the Pacific ocean. It is only about 330 m high, and a very interesting place to visit (I could just mention that it even has a ropeway).

The mountain has a peculiar saw tooth shape due to stone quarrying during the Edo period. There are interesting shapes along the hiking trail, a large Buddha carved out on the side and a large Buddha (Daibutsu) statue carved out of stone near the top.

We depart Tsukuba at 6:30 AM. From the Tsukuba center parking (drop-off/pick-up parking, free for 20 min.)

It is a car based trip, taking the Ken-O expressway towards Narita (avoiding Tokyo) to minimize any traffic delays. It should take about two hours to reach. 
Tsukuba --[Ken-O]--> Takei JCT ---> Miyanoki JCT ---> Futtsu-Kanaya IC exit. Highway toll will cost about 3580 yen each way with ETC.

What to bring: Your breakfast and lunch, water, etc.
What  to wear: Hiking boots, clothes according to the weather.
Club fee 300 yen as usual.
