Description: 

Among the first hikes this year is to Nokogiriyama in Chiba, along the Tokyo Bay coast and a view of the Pacific ocean. It is only about 330 m high, and a very interesting place to visit (I could just mention that it even has a ropeway).

The mountain has a peculiar saw tooth shape due to stone quarrying during the Edo period. There are interesting shapes along the hiking trail, a large Buddha carved out on the side and a large Buddha (Daibutsu) statue carved out of stone near the top.

I am considering a car based trip, taking the Ken-O expressway towards Narita (avoiding Tokyo) to minimize any traffic delays. It should take about two and half hours to reach. We depart Tsukuba at 6:30 AM.
If there are not enough cars, I will change to train option (which costs considerably more).

So, if you are interested in joining, please reply to this mail, and let me know if you have a car (and how many people it can carry).
