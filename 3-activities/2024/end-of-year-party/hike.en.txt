Description: 

**It's time for the TWMC end-of-year party!**

On **Saturday December 14th** we will have the end-of-year hike to Tsukuba-san and the party in “Hot Stuff” in the evening.
The announcement of the hike was sent by Matt last week.

As usual the end-of-year party is for everyone, even people who never joined any hikes are most welcome.
The party is a potluck, so please bring some food to share with others; if possible, some speciality from your region or country.

Don't bring drinks, these will be provided by Hot Stuff (500 yen each).  And please bring your own plates and chopsticks, fork/spoon/knife so we can save some resources.

***Details of the party***
Date: Saturday, December 14th 2023
Time: from 19:00
Venue: Hot Stuff
Tsukuba Central building 2F 2−14−16 Ninomiya, Tsukuba.

For friends who can't make it, Wishing you a very happy holiday season.☆彡

Cheers,

Anja
