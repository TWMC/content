Description: 

With the nights drawing in, many people’s thoughts will be turning to upcoming festivities, and one of the highlights of this time of the year is undoubtedly the TWMC end of year hike.
This will be our final hike of the year, and as tradition demands it will be to our very own mountain, Mt Tsukuba.
The hike will take place on Saturday the 14th of December 2024. The TWMC end of year party will take place on the evening of the same day. 

**Description of the hike**
We will meet at 09:00 in the usual meeting place in the parking by the Tsukuba Center Bus Station, and travel to the parking by Lake Tsukushi to the North West of Mt Tsukuba.
We will hike up the Northern side of the mountain, along trails that are usually nice and quiet, away from the crowds that may be encountered on the Southern routes. It will take us about two hours or so to reach the summit area of Mt Tsukuba, where we will have lunch.  After lunch and taking in the spectacular (weather permitting) views we will head back down the mountain, and should be back at Tsukuba Center by around 16:00.

It is too soon to say much about the weather, but after a very warm November, temperatures look like they will be close to average for December, which may feel a little cold to those of us who have grown unaccustomed to them. Though Mt Tsukuba is not the highest of mountains, it is still possible for the weather to change during a hike, so please be prepared for such eventualities.
Updates about the weather will be included in future updates about the hike. In the event that the weather forecast becomes bad, then the hike may be canceled. However the end of year party will still take place in the evening.

**Summary**
- Date: Saturday the 14th of December.
- Meeting time and place: 09:00 at Tsukuba Center Bus Station parking area.
- Destination: Mt Tsukuba
- Return time: arrive back by about 16:00.

**What to bring:**
- Boots / good walking shoes 
- Warm clothes and/or multiple layers – be prepared for December weather.
- Rain gear in case of changes in the weather.
- Sunblock might be useful if it is a particularly sunny winter day.
- Snacks and lunch (there are also restaurants and shops around the summit area).
