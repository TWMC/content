Description: 

This is the second update of the Oze hike, July 20-21.

The following participants list is more or less final, and will close in two days. [Participants please let me know of any food preferences or allergies, as soon as possible].

We are scheduled to leave from Tsukuba at 5:00 AM on July 20 (Saturday).

 I will possibly send another update before the final update with instructions.

More details are in my announcement copied below.

In addition to the hut accommodation (in my previous mail, copied below), car share will be about 4,000 yen and shuttle bus from Tokura parking 2,000 yen, both ways. Club fee 500 yen. (Lodge cancelation rules will apply, unless replaced by a new participant)

We will go ahead even in rain, unless it is a storm (typhoon). It is fun and beautiful even in rain.

First announcement
We went to Oze last last september, we are planning another hike in summer. We expect to experience a different beauty of Oze at this time. 

It is also the highest season in Oze. Therefore I have made an advance booking of the hut
Akatashiro hut, https://oze-onsengoya.com/

We must give the final number of participants and any meal preferences latest by July 10. The charge is 14,300 yen per person, including dinner and breakfast.

Since this is a peak season, cancellation charges will apply strictly, from 8 days before. 8 to 4 days before: 30%, 4 to 3 days before: 50% and on the same day: 80%.

It is a lot of time from now, but if you decide, you can let me know. It is a car based hike, of course.
