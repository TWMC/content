We will go ahead even in rain, unless it is a storm (typhoon). It is fun and beautiful even in rain.

**First announcement**
I am happy to announce that we shall be going to Oze on the weekend of July 20-21. This is a very popular season for going to Oze. 
https://oze-fnd.or.jp/en/season/

Oze-ga-hara is a beautiful marsh at an altitude of 1,500m, surrounded by mountains. It is beautiful in any season. Walking is mostly flat on wooden paths. Walking map of the area can be seen at https://oze-fnd.or.jp/en/rg/

I have made an early booking (for the night of July 20) at  Akatashiro hut, https://oze-onsengoya.com/  . (It is closer to the waterfalls). Dinner and breakfast will be provided at the hut. The total cost of the hut will be 14,300 yen per person (quite an increase from last year). We need to confirm our reservation (number of persons, any meal preferences) early, because it is the highest season of the year. I need to finalize the list by July 7. So please confirm to me before that.

Since this will be a car based hike, the number of participants with cars will limit the total participation. Therefore we especially welcome participants with cars!

We will leave from Tsukuba at 5:00 AM on July 20.

Oze (at 1,500 m) will be colder than here, so be prepared accordingly. It may rain, so come with rain wear and water resistant shoes with grips (hiking boots preferable).

The hut has a bath/onsen. Bring your own towel kit (do not bring your own soap etc.). After completing the walk on July 21, we will go to onsen 
Hanasaki no Yu

 (You can choose not to go if car arrangements can be made that way).

Walking map of the area can be seen at https://oze-fnd.or.jp/en/rg/
We will park our cars in Tokura and take a shuttle bus to Hatomachi Toge, walk down to Yamanohana (Visitor Center) and have lunch. From there we will start walking in the marsh, in the direction of Miharashi and then to Akatashiro. We will return the next day, after visiting the waterfalls, enjoying the scenery, with some diversions in the route. Climbing Mt. Shibutsu is a possibility for fit hikers if the weather is fine

more details later. Please let me know of your interest, as soon as possible, and if you have a car.
