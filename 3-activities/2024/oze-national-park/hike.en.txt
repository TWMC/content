Description: 

We went to Oze last last september, we are planning another hike in summer. We expect to experience a different beauty of Oze at this time. 

It is also the highest season in Oze. Therefore I have made an advance booking of the hut
Akatashiro hut, https://oze-onsengoya.com/

We must give the final number of participants and any meal preferences latest by July 10. The charge is 14,300 yen per person, including dinner and breakfast.

Since this is a peak season, cancellation charges will apply strictly, from 8 days before. 8 to 4 days before: 30%, 4 to 3 days before: 50% and on the same day: 80%.

It is a lot of time from now, but if you decide, you can let me know. It is a car based hike, of course.
