Details

- Level of difficulty: ** This is a general trail hike, and there is enough time. If someone lacks energy, we can change to a shortcut route.

- I keep a lodge reservation for five people. So, if you are the sixth person, you are on the waitlist (I'll try to make additional reservations first).

- This hike will be canceled in case of heavy rain, which I determine and announce by Sep 27.

- Insurance coverage It is recommended that you get short-term insurance. (https://hoken.montbell.jp/) If you cannot read Japanese or need help, please visit the Montbell shop near the Tsukuba station (https://goo.gl/maps/bjCnkBaNbizZ9hd97).
