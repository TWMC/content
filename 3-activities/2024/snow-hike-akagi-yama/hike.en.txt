Description: 

**One day Akagi snow hike on February 4th, Sunday.**

We will walk at Akagi area, Gunma and visit two peaks, Mt. Kurobi (1828m) and Mt. Komagatake (1685m).
After the hike, we will visit a nice onsen nearby.



Since this event is snow hike (NOT snowshoe hike), I recommend to bring your own crampons.
Kei-eisen (軽アイゼン) is enough for this hike.
6-point type, 4-point type, and chain spikes are available at Mont-Bell shop (Q't).
