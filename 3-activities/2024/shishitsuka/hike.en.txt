Description: 

I am pleased to invite you to a pleasant late morning walk in Shishitsuka, a small region just east of Tsukuba, inside Tsuchiura. The region has a lake surrounded by wooded areas with walking trails. It also exhibits prehistoric archeological artefacts and recreated habitats. 
Shishitsuka is a perfect example of satoyama areas between wilderness and human habitats.

We will start from Tsukuba center in car pools, as usual, and drive  some 5 km to the parking lot of the Archaeological Museum [there is also an option to come directly on bicycles]. This parking lot has restrooms (toilets). It is located here:

After walking for about 2 hours we will have lunch (we need to bring our lunch boxes), walk some more and head back to the parking lot of the museum. Those  interested can visit the museum (entry free). 

Meeting place: Tsukuba Center prop off/pick up parking of the station [free for 20 min.], as usual.

Departure time: 9:30 AM (please do not be late, because we can park only for 20 min.) on October 12 (Saturday)

Or you can come directly to (please let me know)
Walk starting point: parking of Tsuchiura Archaeological Museum 

What to bring: lunch! drinks

What to wear: casual clothes, light walking shoes are fine.

Finishing time: by 2 PM.

So please let me know if you want to join, are coming by car (and how many participants can you take with you), or want to come on bicycle.

Let's hope for a good weather,
This is not a real 'hike', but rather a nature walk.
