Description: 

We’re excited to invite you to our summer BBQ party on June 8th!

This gathering is open to all! Even if you have never been on a hike, please come and join. It is a great chance to share exciting stories about climb and hike, and enjoy good times with BBQ together. 

Participation is free, and TWMC will provide food and non-alcoholic drinks. You can bring a (homemade) dish or (alcoholic) drinks to share. Please bring your plates and cutlery.

It might be cloudy and even rainy. Bring an umbrella to be sure. If it rains heavily, we will consider postponing the event.

We will be there from 10 o'clock and start preparing. If you want to help, please come (I can drive you there). 

Like making fire? Like cook food? We need some volunteers to help take care of the BBQs. 

Date: 8 June 2024 (Saturday)

Time: 10:00 - 15:00

Place: Yukari no Mori

Transportation: You can reach Yukari no Mori by bicycle or car. There is parking available.
