Report: Because it was a car based trip and 3 drivers signed up for the hike we could able to accommodate only 13 participants. We are really sorry that some of the interested people were not able to join this hike. We started from the usual 7/11 at 6:02 am and could reach Seinenoi at 9:30. am. The beginning of the hike was relaxed ; we started climbing up Bandai from Urbandai ski slope. Because the mountain was officially closed to public, trails were bit wild and thrilling. After about an hour's climb, we reached the marshland covered with snow. It was nice to walk through unstable layers of the snow paths. The weather was extremely perfect and the views from the trails were splendid. View of the Bandai-summit in the mirror pond and the Aonuma from the trails are some examples.  We had lunch at the Bandai-summit and descended through the steep sulphur trails, some time it was surprising to see the flat landscape surrounded with red and yellow volcanic rocks like we have reached in some other planet. After the hike we soaked ourselves in Kawakami onsen for a while and headed to the youth hostel where we stayed. After dinner we enjoyed the guitar performance and Russian music by Victoria and friends. Second day we visited the visitor center, where we learned about the geography of Bandai-san and after that we walked around the five color ponds. At 1.30 pm we enjoyed the BBQ near the lakeside. Our BBQ host was so kind to us that we were able to  taste all the leaves and plants in that region (Ooieshi!! Ne!!). We thank all the participants for their kind cooperation in the hike.
