Description: 


Report by 
Ryoko and Ajay: 
First of all, we would like to thank all the 
	participants who joined us and

made this event a success especially Noda-san for 
	helping us in organizing

the cycling, Kurikin-san, Zmutt guesthouse people 
	for their support and

Nicolas, Mark for driving. 

On Saturday, 17th of July, morning most of us 
	except two reach the meeting

point (7/11 near Doho park) in time, and then we 
	waited for the absentees

for about 30 min. At 4:50 am we started from 
	Tsukuba. 

We reached mountain roads in Minami-Aizu around 
	10:00 and at 11:30 am started

the hiking. After a while it started raining, but 
	it was fun to climb

Nanatsugatake through the streams. The rain was 
	getting stronger and trails

were becoming slippery, which make us difficult to 
	reach the summit and we

plan to climb down.  After check-in to the 
	guesthouse we visited an onsen.

After the showery hike and onsen we back to the 
	guesthouse, where we met

Noda-san and others who join us in the cycling 
	event. It was really nice

time and dinner was also delicious. 

In the cycling trip Noda-san lead us. All of us 
	enjoyed cycling around

Minami Aizu, we stopped in the places where we find 
	nice sceneries. Reached

Ouchijukku and had lunch, after the cycle tour we 
	visited an onsen, and back

to Tsukuba (reached around 11:30 hrs)
