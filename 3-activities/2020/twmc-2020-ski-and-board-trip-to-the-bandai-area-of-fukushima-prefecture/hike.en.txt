Description: 

Note that signups for the 2 available cars for this trip are already full, but contact Rick if you can drive your car (with snow tires) or would like to be added to the waiting list. For the 11 to 13 January 2020 holiday weekend, Rick Weisburd and Kyoko Nomura will organize a TWMC ski and snowboard trip to ski resorts in the Bandai area of Fukushima Prefecture. This will be a car-based trip departing at 6:15 am on Saturday 11 January from Tsukuba Station. Assuming smooth road conditions, the drive (about 250 km) will take about 3 Â½ hours. For now, we have 2 cars equipped with studless tires, which can accommodate a total of 8 participants. We have room to carry skis and boards. For participants who do not have their own ski or snowboard gear, we can stop along the way to rent. We should get back to Tsukuba on Monday evening 13 January. 

Our plan is to visit 2 or 3 different ski areas over the 3 days depending on snow conditions. Among the many resorts in the Bandai area are Inawashiro, Alts Bandai, Grandeco, Minowa, and Nekoma. You can find detailed information about these and other Fukushima resorts here:

We have booked 2 nights for group accommodations at Bandai Lakeside Guesthouse.  (includes dinner Saturday and Sunday and continental breakfast Sunday and Monday)

Our rooms can sleep 2 to 3 or 3 to 4. Toilets and ofuro are shared in separate rooms off the hallway. We stayed at the guesthouse last February and really liked it. 

Expected costs/person are as follows:
About 16,500 yen for Saturday and Sunday nights in the guest house including 2 dinners and 2 breakfasts
About 5000 yen for gas and tolls
About 1000 yen trip Insurance 

These trip costs could change slightly.

You will also need to buy lift tickets at each resort. The price of a full day lift ticket at Grandeco or Inawashiro is 4700 yen. For Sunday and Monday, our guesthouse is likely to be able to sell us (all of us) discount coupons for lift tickets.  

Food is available for sale at the resorts, but you can save money by bringing your own lunchs.


What to bring:
Ski or snowboard equipment
Helmet
Warm waterproof outerwear
Warm base layers
Warm gloves or mittens
Goggles (visibility is poor during frequent snowfall)
Boots or shoes for walking around (waterproof recommended)
Change of clothes
Headlamp
Onsen kit
Toiletries 
Snacks

This trip is likely to fill up quickly. The 3 rooms we have reserved at the guesthouse could accommodate another 2 or 3 people, but participation by more than 8 would require another car with studless tires. 

Skiing and boarding are inherently risky activities. TWMC and the organizers take no responsibility for any injuries that might occur. If you want to try skiing or boarding but do not have experience, then please enroll in lessons at the ski resorts; the organizers are not qualified to teach and will not be teaching. The Bandai area ski resorts are small and lessons in English might not be available. 

To sign up, email Rick with your name, email address, keitai number, line id, dietary preferences (vegetarian ok), and whether you will bring or rent skis or a snowboard.
