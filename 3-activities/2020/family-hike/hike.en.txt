Description: 

Organized every year in spring, Family hike is a hike for all abilities! Everyone is recommended to join this walk. You don't necessarily need to come with a family member. People with children are especially encouraged to come, as well as with parents, in-laws or friends.

Hokyo-san is nice for a family hike because of its proximity and moderate height. It is closer from here than Tsukuba-san, and less than half its height. It has panoramic views of Tsukuba, Tsuchiura, Kasumigaura lake, a beautiful view of Tsukuba-san, and on a clear day Mt. Fuji, Tokyo and Mito. 

This year we will take the 'Course 1' route, which has a gentle slope. We will start from the pond (which should be in full Sakura bloom), walk through farms, and up through the forest. We will have lunch at the top.

We will make smaller groups and make a clear understanding to keep some distance between us during personal interactions, in keeping with recent guidelines to avoid spread of viral infection. And if you have traveled recently, you may decide to be responsible and not to join..

Where and when to meet: April 5 (Sunday) 8:30 AM at the Tsukuba station short time parking. This parking allows only up to 20 min. of free parking, so be in time.
We should be back by 16:00 in the afternoon.

Clothing according to weather, and rain protection (in case).
Walking or hiking shoes.

What to bring: a lunch box and drinks (water/ juice/ cha).

Fees: Children and drivers are exempt from club fee of 300 yen.

Let me know if you are coming by car.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!

Inform anyone else who may be interested, especially with children.
