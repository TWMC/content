Description: 

For many of us, Narita is only an airport. But Narita is much more than that. Narita city is a nice and charming place where every year a big taiko (Japanese drums) festival takes place.
The drums are sounding all over the place and there are many special events and a lot of interesting food too.
Narita also houses a very important temple of the Shingon sect, the Naritasan Shinshoji Temple. The temple has extensive grounds so we can still have a nice walk before joining the drums.
