Description: 

Snow shoe hike to Oze.
We have had several club hikes in Oze over the years, but always in the summer or autumn. In the winter and spring, Oze is completely covered in deep snow - so deep that the huts have to be dug out for Golden Week! It is a completely different place from the hot seasons.

The hike will be a two-day trip, leaving early in the morning on Saturday and returning on Sunday night. We will travel by car to the entrance, from where we can directly enter the park (no shuttle bus is necessary). We will hike to the hut on the first day and hike back out on the second. If we have time, we will do some exploring on the first day. We may visit the lake, which will still be frozen, if we arrive at the hut early enough.

Oze is a large highland swamp, which means it is flat. Apart from the first (and last) parts, there is no climbing involved, so the hike will not be too tough. The only difficulty on this hike will be the need to break a trail, as it is not likely to be crowded. We will take turns doing this because it is very tiring.

If you want to participate, you will need the following equipment:
- Snow shoes and poles.
- Well insulated, warm clothing, including good socks and gloves.
- Fully-water-proof outer layer. This means everything except your hat. 
You must have water proof gloves and water proof boots. Sneakers and hiking shoes are not acceptable, you need high-ankled, water proof, well-insulated hiking boots. You must have gaiters. It is also recommended that your jacket be wind proof.
- Sun glasses or ski goggles.
- Suncream.
- A water proof hiking pack. Ideally, it will have a rain cover.
- Lunch. Miso soup in a thermos is a very good idea.

You *must* bring your own snow shoes and poles for this hike. There will be nowhere to hire equipment in Oze. If you do not have snoe shows and poles (or, possibly, cross-country skis), you will not be allowed to join this hike.

The estimated cost for this hike is 25.000 yen, including the hut.
