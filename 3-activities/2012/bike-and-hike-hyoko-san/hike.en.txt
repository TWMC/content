Description: 

We will cycle from Tsukuba Center to Oda, and from there climb Hokyo-san - a small mountain, only 461m, with trails that go past a number of temples, interesting rock formations, woodland, lakes etc. It is an easy, not particularly strenuous day out!

The bike distance is about 10km each way - we will cycle fromTsukuba Center up the walkway, then at Ichinoya turn off and cycle through fields to Oda. We expect this will take anything between 30m to 1 hour, depending on how fast you want to cycle. If you prefer to drive, then you can meet us at the beginning of the walk trail - let us know and we will give you instructions.

The map time for the walk is a little over 3 hours, but it will depend how long we want to spend explore temples, take photos, etc.

Meeting time: 8.00am
Meeting place: By the lake in the park behind Tsukuba Station.
What to bring:
Bicycle
Good boots or shoes for walking (sports shoes probably okay for this walk, but it may be muddy in places)
Rain gear
Warm clothing (layers are good)
Sun block (hat and sunglasses also recommended)
Lunch and snacks
Water (2L recommended)
500 yen club fee, and some extra cash for any incidentals.
