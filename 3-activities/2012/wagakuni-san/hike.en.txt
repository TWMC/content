Description: 

Wagakuni-san 

It's not a difficult walk, but there is one monster slope descent which we always slip and slide down... :)
There will be excellent views across Ibaraki Prefecture of the Kanto Plain and Kasumigaura (if the weather is cooperative), beautiful native forest and the Atago shrine.
 
*Information about the hike*
The hike is from Atago shrine to Fukuhara station, passing by Atago-san → Dango Rock → Byoubu Crag → Nantai-san → Dourokushin Pass → Wagakuni-san → Fukuhara station → Atago shrine.
From Fukuhara station we will take the train back to Iwama station and walk to the Atago shrine (or the drivers can go by taxi).
Walking time: about 5 hours 25 minutes, but the first section (about 40 minutes) along a bitumen read could be eliminated by taking a taxi to Atago shrine.

*Meeting place* at the bus terminal in Tsukuba center at *8 am*.
Please be on time, because there is only 20 minutes free parking in the bus terminal.
We hope to be at the Atago shrine at around 9:00-9:15 

*Costs*
- club fee 300 yen
- share of costs in gasoline etc. except for drivers
- train from Fukuhara to Iwama 400 yen

*What to bring*
- rain gear
- hiking shoes
- lunch and water
