Description: 

Hokyo-san Family hike only means that it is for all abilities and ages! You don't need to be married or have children to join it. But people with children are encouraged to come (who may not have such outdoor opportunities otherwise), as well as with parents, in-laws or friends.

We will go to Mt. Hokyo-san, which is closer from here than Tsukuba-san, and less than half its height. We will visit castle ruins first, then walk through farms, and then up through the forest.

Where and when to meet: The usual 7-11 convenience store near Doho Park and Hot Stuff at 9 AM.
We should be back by 16:00 in the afternoon.

Clothing according to weather, and rain protection (in case).
Walking or hiking shoes.
What to bring: a lunch box and drinks (water/ juice/ cha).
Fees: Children and drivers are exempt from club fee of 500 yen.
