Description: 

Snow shoe trip at Kirigamine, Nagano-ken.  

This snow shoe hike is designed to enjoy relatively flat and open hill in area of Kirigamine Hiland. Kirigamine-Hiland (around 1500m high from sea level) is located near Shirakaba-lake and 5km north-west of Tateshina-yama
which is a northern part of Yatugadake.  In winter this area is an ideal space for cross-country ski and snow shoe walk. The walking route is not very difficult, probably for beginners to those who are getting used to walk using snow shoe for a couple of times.

First day(11th) : After getting hut in Kirigamine, we walk directly from hut to open hill of Kirigamine. The destination is Kuruma-yama which is the highest peak in this area. Probably, it takes less than 2 hours to get the summit. We could have a marvellous view from the top over Yatsugatake to Mt Fuji if the weather is our side.

Second day:   We will walk to Yashima-marshland where is completely covered with snow in middle of winter. And we are heading to the east side of Kirigamine nearby Kurumayama ski area. I suppose we spend 4~5 hours for
walk including lunch time.

What you need for this walk:
- Well insulated, warm clothing, including good socks and gloves. (As this area is open space, it would be very cold if it is windy….)
- Fully-water-proof outer layer. This means everything except your hat. You must have water proof gloves and water proof boots. Sneakers and hiking shoes are not acceptable, you need high-ankled, water proof,well-insulated
winter hiking boots. You must have gaiters. It is also recommended that your jacket be wind proof.
- Sun glasses or ski goggles (It is essential on snow….).
- Suncream (up to your skin condition…..).
- A water proof hiking pack. Ideally, it will have a rain cover.
- Lunch. Tea, coffee and miso soup in a thermos would help you to keep yourself warm from inside…

You *do not* need to bring your own snow shoes or poles for this hike, unless you already have some. We will hire snow shoes for those who don't have their own.
