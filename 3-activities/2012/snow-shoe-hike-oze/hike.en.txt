Description: 

Snow shoe hike to Oku-Nikko. 

The hike will be a one-day trip, leaving early in the morning and returning the same night. We will travel by train to Nikko, and from there travel by bus (about one hour) to the Senjo-ga-hara area. We may also throw in some car early in the trip for added fun (and to save time). Once in the area, we will go for a light stroll around the swamp
and perhaps to see the massive Yudaki waterfall (湯滝). I expect we will have 4 or 5 hours of walking.
The area we will be in is almost entirely flat and easy to walk in. 

If you want to participate, you will need the following equipment:
- Well insulated, warm clothing, including good socks and gloves.
- Fully-water-proof outer layer. This means everything except your hat.
You must have water proof gloves and water proof boots. Sneakers and hiking shoes are not acceptable, you need high-ankled, water proof, well-insulated hiking boots. You must have gaiters. It is also recommended that your jacket be wind proof.
- Sun glasses or ski goggles.
- Sun-cream.
- A water proof hiking pack. Ideally, it will have a rain cover.
- Lunch. Miso soup in a thermos is a very good idea.

You *do not* need to bring your own snow shoes or poles for this hike, unless you already have some. We will hire snow shoes for those who don't have their own.

The estimated cost is under 10,000 yen.
