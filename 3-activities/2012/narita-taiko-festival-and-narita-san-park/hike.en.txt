Description: 

Narita taiko festival and Narita-san park

Probably all of you know the name Narita, because of the airport. But how many of you have visited the town of Narita? It is a very pretty historical town and is famous for its temple, Narita-san.
Every year in April there is a two-day taiko (traditional Japanese drum) festival in Narita town. In the next TWMC 'walk' we will visit Narita and enjoy the taiko festival.
Narita-san temple is situated in a beautiful park on a hill, so we will also do a bit of walking (or rather strolling). For those interested there is also a calligraphy museum in the park.

As we do not want to miss the 10 a.m. opening event where hundreds of drummers perform in front of Narita-san, we have to arrive in Narita at around 9:30 a.m. After the opening event we will walk around the park and then go back to the town center where many taiko groups and other musicians will be playing. From 3 to 5 p.m. there is a final parade with many of the participating groups joining.

You do not have to bring anything except comfortable shoes and rain gear just in case. Narita has a lot of local food specialties and there will be food and drinks all over the place.
