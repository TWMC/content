Report: 

Oze,
Surely Oze is one of the best walking course in Japan and there were as many as 17 participants(!) on Oze trip.
There were many newcomers thanks to Koichi's well organized PR. 
It turned out that we visited Oze in the best period and could enjoy beautiful autumn leaves. I took easy option on both days and enjoyed relaxed walk, occasionally stopping at beautiful trees, taking photos.
We could see red and yellow leaves of white birch, maples, horse chesnuts and oaks on the walk. You can see easy-walk photos below.
