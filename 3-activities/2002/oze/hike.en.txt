Description: Oze,
Surely Oze is one of the best walking course in Japan and 
there were as many as 17 participants(!) on Oze trip.
There were many newcomers thanks to Koichi's well organized PR.
It turned out that we visited Oze in the best period and could
enjoy 
beautiful autumn leaves. I took easy option on both days and enjoyed

relaxed walk, occasionally stopping at beautiful trees, taking
photos.
We could see red and yellow leaves of white birch, maples, horse
chesnuts and
oaks on the walk. You can see easy-walk photos below.
