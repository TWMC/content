Description: Dewa-sanzan,
Although the weather was not always perfect, and one of the cars managed to
hold a D-tour to Sendai on the way, all the people on both 2 days and 3 days
options enjoyed the peaceful night stay in Haguro-san shrine, and completed
the visit of 3 holy mountains. Here are some pictures of Day 1 and Day 2.
