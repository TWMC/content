Description: We were a bit unlucky with the traffic, it took us one
hour from Sakura-Tsuchiura to Tsuchiura-Kita due to a
bad traffic jam (accident and beginning of obon) and
another 2 1/2 from there to Iwama (route 6 was jammed,
too, so in the end we took those very small roads that
run alongside the highway in most places. Finally our (Stefan's)
car managed to miss the narrow road that leads to the
trailhead and we drove up and down the valley for more
than half an hour trying to find the others, but we
caught up with them on the trail.
Being almost 4 hours late, unfortunatly we did not have
too much time for swimming, but we still managed to have
a quick dip in two of the pools along the trail. Very
enjoyable trip !
