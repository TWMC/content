Description: 

This is a very peak season for going to Oze, autumn up there.
https://oze-fnd.or.jp/en/season/

Oze-ga-hara is a beautiful marsh at an altitude of 1,500m, surrounded by mountains. It is beautiful in any season. Walking is mostly flat on wooden paths. Walking map of the area can be seen at

Will stay at Akatashiro hut, https://oze-onsengoya.com/ on Sept 27. (It is closer to the waterfalls).
Dinner and breakfast will be provided at the hut. 
The total cost of the hut will be 14,300 yen per person (+1,100 yen for lunch takeout for Sunday).

We will leave from Tsukuba at 5:00 AM on Sept 27.

Oze (at 1,500 m) will be colder than here, so be prepared accordingly.
It may rain, so come with rain wear and water resistant shoes with grips (hiking boots preferable).

The hut has a bath/onsen. Bring your own towel kit (do not bring your own soap etc.). 
After completing the walk on Sept 28, we will go to onsen Hanasaki no Yu.

(You can choose not to go if car arrangements can be made that way).

We will park our cars in Tokura and take a shuttle bus to Hatomachi Toge, walk down to Yamanohana (Visitor Center) and have lunch (brought from home).
From there we will start walking in the marsh, in the direction of Miharashi and then to Akatashiro. We will return the next day, after visiting the waterfalls, enjoying the scenery, with some diversions in the route. Climbing Mt. Shibutsu is a possibility for fit hikers if the weather is fine.
