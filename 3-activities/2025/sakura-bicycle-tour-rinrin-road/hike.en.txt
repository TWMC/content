Description: 

First update 
Thank you to those of you who have expressed your interest in joining the cherry blossom viewing bike ride along the ring ring road next Saturday.  If you are interested in joining, there is still time - the details can be found below.  The weather forecast is looking okay at the moment, with nice temperatures, but a chance of rain.  I'll send another update later in the week. 

Dear TWMC members,
      Spring is here, and the cherry blossoms will soon start to appear.  On Saturday the 5th of April, we would like to have a bike ride event along the Ring Ring Road to view the cherry blossoms along the route.

      The Ring Ring Road (also spelled "Rin Rin Road", りんりんロード in Japanese) is a cycle path created from the route of an old train line, and it offers fantastic views of the countryside around Mt Tsukuba and of the mountain itself.  This time of year, the views are enhanced by the blooming of beautiful trees along the route, many of  which line the sides of the road creating a tunnel of flowers to cycle through.  If you have never cycled the route before, or if you have at a different time of year, then this is a great time to experience it.

Activity details:

Meeting point:  By Tsukuba Centre Station Temporary Parking (the usual meeting point for most TWMC activities)
Meeting Time: Saturday the 5th of April 2025 at 09:30.
Route:  We will cycle through Tsukuba along Tsukuba Koen Dori, and then across to the Ring Ring Road, and head North towards and around Mt Tsukuba, before returning.  This is a very flat course that is suitable for most bikes.  We will cycle at the pace of the slowest rider, and make plenty of cherry blossom viewing and photo stops.  We should return to Tsukuba Centre around early afternoon.

What to bring:
- A bike - should be in reasonable condition for a few hours cycling along a flat course.
- Bike helmet.
- Layers/rain gear incase of changes in the weather.
- Sunblock.
- Snacks and lunch (we will also pass some convenience stores on the route).
- Water.

If the weather forecast is poor for the day, this trip may be cancelled.  I will send out updates, including the weather situation, closer to the date.  Should the blooming occur much later than expected, there is a very slight possibility to postpone the activity to the following weekend.

If you would like to join, please send me an email with the following information:
- Name
- Phone number
- Names of any persons accompanying you, if applicable.


TWMC has a club fee of 300 yen for adults taking place in club activities; free for children.
