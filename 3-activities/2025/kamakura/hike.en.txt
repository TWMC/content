Report: 

This Kamakura hike was organized after about 12 years. It was scheduled towards the end of May. There were concerns about rain as the day approached. Finally, it looked like it would be cloudy but not rain until late afternoon. This was no problem because this was in the middle of an urban area and it was possible to change plans midway.

We five participants went from Tsukuba and were joined by three more at Kita Kamakura. We took a rapid train to Akihabara at 6:59 AM. Then
we took a JR train to Shimbashi station and changed to the Yokosuka line to reach Kita Kamakura at 9:00. We might as well have changed to the Yokosuka line at Tokyo station. At both these stations the Yokosuka line is deep underground. (Tokaido line would have been faster but required another change before Kita Kamakura).

The sky was overcast but bright. After meeting up at Kita Kamakura we went inside the Engakuji temple complex, visited the main shrine and side ones with their interesting statues of Buddha, relaxed viewing the garden (it looked like this will be very colorful in autumn), and walked until the end of the complex viewing the seasonal flowers etc. and talking. We came out soon after 10:00 AM and started walking towards the south.

We decided to skip Meigetsu-in temple in the interest of time and proceeded to Kenchoji temple to arrive there past 10:30 AM. There was a large (annual?) prayer being held at the main building, so we could see it only from the outside. We visited the garden and came out soon after 11:00 AM to proceed to the hiking trail from the back exit.

We climbed the stairs up the hill to reach the Ten-en trail at about 11:30 AM, had a view from there and got on the trail. At this time of the year the forest was lush green and the singing of birds could be heard all along. We came to Mt. Oyama at about noon. At first we sat down to lunch on rocks at the peak, but a big bird swooped down and knocked Rick's lunch out of his hands. So we climbed down on the other side where all the other hikers were eating lunch in a large clearing. We ate and relaxed. There was a nice view of Yokohama on one side.

We visited a plant nursery where the trail started going down. It had very exotic flowers. We enjoyed the long descent route talking, arriving at Zuisenji temple at about 2:00 PM and enjoying walking in its gardens, lush green and covered in moss.

We started walking on city roads towards Hachimangu gardens. Near its gates we sat in a nice cafe and talked and relaxed for about an hour. It was almost 4:00 PM now and time to head to Kamakura station. Following a discussion, I changed the original plan to take the main avenue in front, and walk through the interesting Komachi Dori street. It was a `fatal' decision, for we were lost in the exotic variety of food and drinks offered on the way. Some of us even bought a bottle of Kamakura beer and started drinking.

We finally arrived at the station at about 5:00 PM. Just about when the station came into sight, rain drops started falling, gently. We took trains to various destinations, three of us coming back  directly to Tsukuba, arriving by 7:30 PM.
