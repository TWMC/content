Description: 

This hike was originally scheduled for Saturday March 29, but it has been postponed to April 12. 

This hike is open for all ages and abilities. People with kids are especially welcome. You can write to me anytime for any consultation. And you can invite friends.

Where: Mt. Hokyo in Tsukuba

Schedule: Gathering point (for car pooling) from the Tsukuba station temporary (drop-off - pick-up) parking (free for 20 min.) by 9:20 AM (try to arrive here by 9:10)

Hike starting point: Hiking Course 1, starting from the pond (Hojo Oike). The most gentle hiking course. See the map here:

The Parking will be at the Taikan physical activities center (point S in map above), at location

We will use the toilets here before setting off for walking.

Families coming in cars, who will not join in the car pooling, can come directly to this parking by 9:45 AM (confirm the plan with me in advance). We plan to gather in the parking by 10 AM to start walking.

At a gentle pace, it takes about 120 min. to walk to the top. There are mountain toilets at the top.

We will have lunch (please bring with you)  in an open area before reaching the top, marked "つくば万博の森" in the map in the link above (PDF file).

The peak is another 15 min. climb from there. At the top, we will relax, take in the scenery, and then walk back. We should be back at the parking by 16:00 h.

Club fee of 300 yen will apply, except for drivers and children.

I am looking forward to hearing from you. Let me know if you are interested in joining, and if you a car and can give a ride, or if you need a ride.
