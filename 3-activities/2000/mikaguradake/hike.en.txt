(first day).

      Björn demonstrating true grace and the 
      complete uselessness of hiking poles in 
      rock climbing.
On Haku-san (second day). From the left: Björn, 
      Les, Masako, Cedric, Terry and Mieko Togai. She said 
      she wanted to stay on the mountain because she had a 
      husband and kids at home waiting to be fed.
      Kouichi was also on that trip, but he somehow managed 
      to be on precisely 0 photos.
