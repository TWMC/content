Description: 
Our group on top of the rotating restaurant.
      From left: Paul,
      Masako, Cedric, Claire, Björn, Kouichi, Christer, 
      Niclas and Tadashi


Masako (left) and Kouichi (right)

The toad-rock near Tsukuba-san's female 
      peak. If you throw a rock into the toads 
      mouth and it doesn't fall out, you
      have a free wish.

 
Kouichi tries his luck at the toad rock 
      while Paul (behind him) has spotted 
      something more interesting

Somebody suggested that 
      Masako was taking a 
      pee-break here


There were also suggestions about just what
      Cedric is doing here, but they cannot be repeated here

??, a small shrine on the way down


Do you want to be here during
      an erthquake?
