Description: 

As scheduled on Sunday morning 8 October, I will lead a cycling tour northeast to the Koise River cycling path and back past the fruit stands in the Chiyoda area. The total distance will be approximately 52 km. We will ride mainly on small rural roads, but there will be some short stretches on roads with traffic. There will be some small hills but most of the route is pretty flat. There might be some short unpaved sections. I usually see some wildlife, like weasels and peregrine falcons, along this route. We’ll ride at whatever pace is comfortable for the slowest participant and won’t leave anyone behind.

Meet at the Tsukuba Center bus station at 9:00 am for a 9:10 departure. If persistent or moderate to heavy rain seems very likely, the tour will be postponed by email sent Saturday evening, 7 October. Be sure that your bicycle is in good working order and your tires have appropriate air pressure. Because brains are soft and helmets are hard, helmets are strongly recommended. There will be one or two convenience store break along the way, but bring at least water. We should be back by early afternoon.

Masks are optional while riding, but bring one at least for convenience store stops. To sign up, email to rickweisburd@gmail.com with your name and keitai number.

TWMC charges a 300 yen fee from adult participants (children are free) for day trips, which I will collect. Cycling entails some risk of accidents and injuries for which TWMC and I bear no responsibility.
