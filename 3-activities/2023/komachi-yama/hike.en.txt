Description: 

Despite the recent heavy rains the hike is planned for Sunday the 11th of June.  

The hike is at Komachi-yama, a relatively close mountain.  The starting point is by Komachi no Yakata (http://tsuchiura-n.or.jp/service1.html).  It is a relatively short hike, about 1.5 to 2 hours total hiking time plus breaks, but the top of the mountain offers a great view of Mt Tsukuba and also has a nice shady picnic area where we can eat lunch.

The weather forecast is looking mixed at the moment, but the forecast for the weekend is looking better.  I will check the trail, and the weather forecast, on Saturday morning, and if necessary, the hike will be postponed, and I will send the announcement by Saturday afternoon at the latest.

As it is quite a short hike, there will also be an optional bike ride as well from Tsukuba Center to Komachi no Yakata.  
     
<b>Meeting time:</b>
For those travelling by car, the meeting time will be 09:50 at Tsukuba Center parking, next to the bus terminal.  For those travelling by bike the meeting time will be 09:20, also from the Tsukuba Center parking.  You are also free to travel directly to Komachi no Yakata if you wish.

Everyone should aim to meet at Komachi no Yakata at 10:30 ready to start hiking at about 11:00.  There is some contingency to allow for delays and finding parking.  If you arrive early or have some time to spare there are some restaurants/cafes and a souvenir shop at Komachi no Yakata.
We will have lunch at the summit at about 12:00, before returning.
