<b>First announcement: Family Hike for April 29, 2023 (Saturday).</b>

The hike was originally on April 8th but is now rescheduled for Saturday 29th April. 
It is the first day of the Golden Week. I believe it will be a relaxed weekend and convenient to most.

To remind you: This hike is open for all ages and abilities. People with kids are especially welcome. You can write to me anytime for any consultation. And you can invite friends.

Where: Mt. Hokyo in Tsukuba

Schedule: Gathering point (for car pooling)  from the Tsukuba station temporary (drop-off - pick-up) parking (free for 20 min.) by 9:30 PM. (try to arrive here by 9:20)

Hike starting point: Hiking Course 1, starting from the pond (Hojo Oike). The most gentle hiking course. See the map here:
https://www.city.tsukuba.lg.jp/material/files/group/110/R02_12_houkyousan_trekking_map.pdf

The Parking will be the Taikan physical activities center　(point S in map above).

We will use the toilets here before setting off for walking.

Families coming in cars, who will not join in the car pooling, can come directly to this parking by 10:00 AM (confirm the plan with me in advance). We plan to gather in the parking by 10 AM to start walking.

At a gentle pace, it takes about 120 min. to walk to the top. There are mountain toilets at the top.

We will have lunch (please bring with you) at the top, relax, take in the scenery, and then walk back.

Covid measures: Up to you, and the comfort of your fellow walkers. Officially there are none.

Let me know if you are interested in joining, and if you a car and can give a ride, or if you need a ride. 

(in case of poor weather on Saturday, the hike may be postponed to Sunday April 9th.
