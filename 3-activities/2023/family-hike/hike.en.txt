Description: 

The family hike was announced for the weekend of March 24-25 but, among some other things, the weather doesn't look too good. 

I am thinking of the weekend of April 8-9 (by that time, I hope the kafunsho hay fever will also decline, for those afflicted by it). The place will be Hokyo-san, as in previous years.
