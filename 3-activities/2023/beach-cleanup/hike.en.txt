Description: 

I am organizing a beach clean-up on Sunday 9 July at Top Sante Beach: 3JP5+98 Hokota, Ibaraki

Top Sante is the same beach that we cleaned in 2019: https://www.twmc.club/activities/2019/beach-onsen-trip-ibaraki

Lots of waste (mainly plastic) washes ashore on our coasts. We will spend several hours gathering, sorting, and bagging waste, which we will leave in the parking lot for Hokota City to later pick up. Bring sunscreen, hats, work gloves, plenty of water to drink, lunch, and a well-fitting mask to wear in the car (Covid-19 is still circulating). I will bring a cooler. Metal mesh for screening out sand from trash and long barbeque tongs can be helpful. Other beach toys, tents, and chairs are optional. You are welcome to swim or surf, but note that there are no lifeguards on this beach. Usually the waves are not so big, but sometimes the surf is big and it is too far in advance to predict surf conditions for that day. Riptides do occur all along the Ibaraki coast. Children are welcome, but should be supervised by adults at all times.

 

There are no bathrooms at the beach, but there are public facilities just up the hill in the onsen parking lot: https://topsante-hokota.com/

If participants like, we will stop for a soak in the onsen (850 yen) on our way home; a change of clothes is pleasant after onsen. We expect to finish our cleanup late morning and should get back to Tsukuba by early to mid-afternoon.

 

This will be a car based trip departing from Tsukuba Station parking lot at 8 am. Please arrive by 7:50. To sign up, please email me with your name, cell phone number, whether you can drive, and if so, how many passengers your car can fit (excluding the driver).

 

Costs: 300 yen club fee plus a share of the cost for car fuel (drivers excluded)

The organizer and TWMC accept no responsibility for participant safety.

The trip might be postponed in the case of bad weather. 

best,

rick
