<b>First announcement: Family Hike for April 29, 2023 (Saturday).</b>

The hike was originally on April 8th but is now rescheduled for Saturday 29th April. 
It is the first day of the Golden Week. I believe it will be a relaxed weekend and convenient to most.

To remind you: This hike is open for all ages and abilities. People with kids are especially welcome. You can write to me anytime for any consultation. And you can invite friends.

Where: Mt. Hokyo in Tsukuba

Schedule: Gathering point (for car pooling)  from the Tsukuba station temporary (drop-off - pick-up) parking (free for 20 min.) by 9:30 PM. (try to arrive here by 9:20)

Report: 

I am happy to report on the Family Hike on the 29th April 2023, on what turned out to be a very fine and sunny day! The hike was originally scheduled for April 8, but had to be rescheduled because of rain.

On this day we, 10 adults and 4 kids (2 years to 12 years old), proceeded to the starting point of the hike in 6 cars (4 directly and 2 via the gathering point of TX station at 9:20 AM). We parked at the sports training center near Oda Oike (pond), gathered together and started walking at about 10 AM. 

The hiking Course 1 is not only gentle, but free of any crowds. We reached the memorial just before the peak at 11:30 and decided to have a break and eat lunch.

Hotaka (2) and Kenzo (5) walked and ran along excitedly! 

We proceeded to the peak at about 12:00 noon. There were many groups of people at the top, at lunch time. We took in the panoramic views. The horizon was a bit hazy due to humidity. Yuji had brought a burner, a big bottle of water and five kinds of herbal mix (non-caffeine) teas. He made tea and served us all. We decided to start descending at about 1:30 PM and reached the end point of the parking lot at about 2:30.

While going down Hotaka slept on his father's shoulders, but started running as soon as he woke up from deep sleep.

I thank all the participants for joining in and making the hike fun and exciting with conversations. (and I am sorry for some who had registered to join on the original date but could not due to rescheduling)
