Description: 

This is the first announcement of one day Nikko snowshoe hike on Feb. 11th Saturday.

We will walk Senjogahara (戦場ヶ原) area, Nikko, Tochigi. The destination is frozen Iori-daki waterfall (庵滝)
(Perhaps I will change the route depending on the course condition and participants.)
After the hike, we will visit nice onsen.

I found a very recent Japanese hiking report on the internet.
