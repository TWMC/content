We need to confirm the final number of participants, type of meals (vegetarian, vegan, and others), and any other requests, until early September. So please  confirm it for me until that time.

Since this will be a car based hike, the number of participants with cars will limit the total participation. We especially welcome participants with cars!

Oze (at 1,500 m) will be in autumn, and winter clothes will be necessary.

Walking map of the area can be seen at https://oze-fnd.or.jp/en/rg/
We will park our cars in Tokura and take a shuttle to Hatomachi Toge, from where we will start walking in the marsh, in the direction of Miharashi. We will return the way the next day, enjoying the scenery, with some diversions in the route.

more details later. Please let me know of your interest.
