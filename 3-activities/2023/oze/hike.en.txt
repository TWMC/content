Description: 

This hike was originally planned for July, but all the mountain huts were fully booked. The September dates are not fixed and might change. 

Oze National Park is a mountainous region encompassing natural wonders that include one of Japan’s largest highland marshes. It is home to diverse flora and rare wildlife such as the Japanese stoat and the country’s smallest dragonfly. 
This 2-day hike we will explore the marsh-land and stay overnight in one of the mountain huts.
