Description: 

It has been a long tradition in TWMC that the last hike of the year, the so-called end-of-year hike, is on Tsukuba san.
This year we will climb our own Twin Peaks on Saturday December 9th, 2023.

The end-of-year party will at night at the completely made-over HS. 
The Oilman Brothers band will be there with live music to liven up the event.   
More details about the party will follow. 


*Details of the hike

We will climb the north side of the mountain, starting from Tsukushiko. 
Passing by the Yakuo-in temple, we will walk along quiet paths away from the crowds.
The walk is relatively easy, but more strenuous than the usual routes from the main shrine.
Walking time up and down will be approximately 4 hours (not including breaks). 
We will probably be back in Tsuksuba around of before 16:00.

On the way down, there are quite a number of steps, so bring walking sticks if you donâ€™t want to ruin your knees.

*Meeting time: 8:30 a.m.
*Meeting place: Car waiting area, Tsukuba bus terminal

*What to bring:
- Boots / good walking shoes
- Warm clothes, it can be chilly at the summit in December
- Rain gear
- Lunch and snacks to share (you can also buy lunch on the summit)
- Water

If you would like to join, please send the following information:
- Name and cell phone number
- Can you offer your car? How many passengers can you take?

No club fee is being charged for this walk. 
Please arrange with the drivers to cover the fee of gasoline etc.  

Hope to see you on December 9th,
cheers,
