Description: 

This is the first announcement for the Tanigawa-dake hike on the 12th-13th of August. This is a two-day, one-night trip to Tanigawa-dake, one of 100 Famous Japanese mountains!!

It will be a car-based hike, departing Tsukuba on the morning of Sunday the 12th of August around 5:30.

On the first day, we climb from the Doai-guchi station of the ropeway towards the direction of the top of Tanigawa-dake. We plan to arrive at the Tanigawa-dake-katano hut where we will stay at 15:00, with around an hour break in between. The next morning, the 13th of August, we will climb to the top of Tanigawa-dake. Tanigawa-dake's weather is changeable, so if we have time on the first day, we can challenge to go to the top. Going to the top with good weather is worth the challenge because from the hut to the top is good to view and there are photo spots. After arriving at the top, we will return to Doai-guchi station on the ropeway the same way we came. If you don't have enough energy left to return, you can choose to get the ropeway to Doai-guchi station.

<b>Plan in brief</b>
Aug 12   Sat    Depart Tsukuba 5:30 for Doai-guchi station. (approx. 3 hours)
                        We will start climbing as soon as we are ready.
                        Doai-guchi station -> Kumaanasawa refuge hut -> Tanigawa-dake-katano hut
                        Schedule time: 4 hours
                       
Aug 13   Sun   Depart Tanigawa-dake-katano hut 7:00 for Top of Tanigawa-dake
                        Tanigawa-dake-katano hut -> To of Tanigawa-dake -> Tanigawa-dake-katano hut -> Doai-guchi station
                        Schedule time: 4 hours 30 minutes

In case of rain, this hike will cancel which I determine and announce by Aug 11.

<b>Level of difficulty: **</b>
This is a two-day schedule, but I believe it has enough time for even beginners to participate.  If you do not have enough energy left to go downhill, please do not force yourself and use the ropeway. If you want to know the detailed situation of the course, please refer to the following map and climb video.
