Description: 

Yarigatake (槍ヶ岳) is perhaps one of the most recognizable peaks in Japan. It is one of the 100 Famous Japanese Mountains. The 3,180-metre-high peak lies in the southern part of the Hida Mountains (Northern Alps) of Japan, on the border of Ōmachi and Matsumoto in Nagano Prefecture and Takayama in Gifu Prefecture. 

This 3-day hike will be in August, but the dates have not been fixed.
