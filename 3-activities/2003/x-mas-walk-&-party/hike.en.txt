Description: 

First let me thank the organizers Ajay and Ryoko (though she herself didn't join the hike) for such an enjoyable hike and party at hot staff. I extend my thanks to Master San and Nori Chan too!..
The weather was perfect - warm, clear, sunny, no wind - we couldn't have had a better day for a hike . As you can see in the pictures, we painted the mountain red by wearing Santa Caps. And Santa Sans Ajay and Sweta played their roles perfectly much to the kids' amusement. 

Their reaction was like "(looking at Ajay and Sweta) Mitte, Santa San! (then looking at the whole gang) Arrey Ippai iru wa ne!! :-)". Other local hikers stopped us occasionally to take our pictures. 

Sorry I was too tired to take pictures during the party but everyone enjoyed the food and gift game.
