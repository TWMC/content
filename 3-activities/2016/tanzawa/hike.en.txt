Description: 

This is the second announcement of Tanzawa hike.
As of now, 5 people are going to go. We have two cars and still more people can join us.

*To avoid traffic jam, let me change the meeting time to 5:30 at Tsukuba center parking lot (next to the bus terminal).

*Also, let me change the hiking route without changing the map time. I recommend to go Mt. San-noto instated of Mt. Tanzawa.
Okura gate (大倉どんぐりハウス) - Okura ridge (大倉尾根) - Mt. San-noto (三ノ塔, 1205ｍ) - Mt. Tono (塔ノ岳, 1,491 m) -  Sonbutsu-sanso at Mt. Tono (尊仏山荘)
Map time : 5.5 hours
  
*Make sure to bring your lunch for the day 1.
For day 2, I expect that we can arrive at the parking lot before noon.

Note that Nabeyaki-udon (\1000) at Nabewari hut is very nice. But the estimated time of arrival there may be too early. (see https://hyakkei.me/articles-090 if you are interested)

This is the first announcement for Tanzawa (丹沢) hike on July 2 and 3.
This route is very nice for the first step in serious hikes and practice/preparation for Japan alps mountains.  Therefore, this event is highly recommended for people who are willing to challenge multi-day hike.

Tanzawa mountains are located in the north side of Kanagawa prefecture. View from the summits and ridges are very good and there are many wild deers.
I'm planning to leave Tsukuba on the morning (6 a.m.) of Saturday and hike in Tanzawa area as follows
 
*Day 1:
Okura gate (大倉どんぐりハウス) - Okura ridge (大倉尾根) - Mt. Tono (塔ノ岳, 1,491 m) - Mt. Tanzawa (丹沢山, 1567, optional) - Sonbutsu-sanso at Mt. Tono (尊仏山荘)
Map time : 5.5 hours
  
*Day 2
Mt. Tono - Mt. Nabewari (鍋割山, 1272 m famous for Nabeyaki-udon) - Okura gate
Map time ; 3.5 hours
After the hike, we will go to Onsen!

*We are going to stay at Sonbutsu-sanso hat (尊仏山荘).

Report: 

This is the hike report of the Tanzawa hike (2nd and 3rd July).

We (Deepa, Anja, Ayako, Kyoko, Mihoko, Noboru, and Kotaro) left Tsukuba at 7:15 and arrived at Okura (大倉) Donguri house at 9:15.
We  crossed a bridge and started walking. Between Okura and Ushikubi, it was very hot and humid!
From Ushikubi, serious mountain trail started and we continuously climbed.
We arrived at the summit of Mt. San-noto (三ノ塔) at around noon and had lunch.
On the ridge between there and Mt. Tonodake, we enjoyed relatively comfortable walk, shaved ice  (かき氷), slightly technical chain zone.

We arrived at the summit of Mt. Tonodake (塔ノ岳), namely the hut we stayed that is Sonbutsu-sanso hut (尊仏山荘) at 15:20.
At that moment, it was foggy. But after 18:00, we could see Mt. Fuji!
Dinner at the hut was (is always) curry rice. 

Next day, the weather got better and also we could see sea of clouds, sunrise, and of course Mt. Fuji (maybe Thierry on the top).
Breakfast at the hut was Oden. 
We left the hut at around 6:30 for the next summit Mt. Nabewari (鍋割山).
The Nabewari hut is famous for Nabeyaki-udon (鍋焼きうどん). Of course, we arrived at there at 7:30, too early for udon.
However, a staff at the hut kindly served 3 pods of udon before the opening hours.
After udon, we got down the mountain and arrived at Okura before noon.
Then we went Tsurumaki onsen (鶴巻温泉), enjoyed onsen and soba.

The traffic condition on the return route was very good and we could arrived at Tsukuba at around 4:00
