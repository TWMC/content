Description: 

Hello everyone,

I will organize a bicycle trip to the foot of Tsukuba-san on April 3, Sunday.
There are many sakura (cherry) trees along the ring-ring road. Hopefully they bloom a lot by Sunday. And lovely small event "Otome-no- Tsukuba-michi" is held on the weekend around Tsukuba-michi. So, we will stop at some places to enjoy it as well. And we also walk sometimes.

Meeting time: 9:30
Meeting place: Central Park at Tsukuba Center, next to the police box
Distance: about 15 km one way
Club fee: 300yen
What to bring: lunch and drinks

If you would like to join the trip, please let me know your name and phone number.

Please participate in the trip at your own risk.

Report: 

It was raining in the morning so I decided to change the meeting time to 12:00. 
We started from the center around 12:15, stopped at Sakura minkaen (old Japanese house), cycled through the university of Tsukuba. Many of cherry blossoms were in bloom there. It was around 12:50 when we got to the ring-ring road near Fujisawa, Tsuchiura. There were so many sakura trees along the ring-ring road but none of them were in bloom... Little after we past Oda castle ruins, we found two people enjoying hanami (picnic) under the cherry blossom in bloom of 10 percent. But soon after we left there, we found a cherry tree in full bloom. We were so happy to see it. After that, we saw more and more sakura in bloom. We enjoyed cycling and watching sakura, it was cloudy and sky was gray though. We dropped off ring-ring road little before Tsukuba-san-guchi and headed to Hiuchi-ga-ike pond. I really liked the place.
After that, we were planning to go to Inaba-shuzo (sake brewery) for lunch. However we took wrong way and got to Iina jinja shrine which is considered as the oldest shrine in Tsukuba. We washed our money to success in business. For more information about Iina jinja, it is good idea to visit TsukuBlog. http://tinyurl.com/hz5jhzv
Some participants enjoyed sake tasting at Inaba-shuzo. The lunch was lekker (delicious)! It was already around 16:20
when we left there. However we still decided to walk along Tsukuba-michi. We walked up to Tsukuba-san shrine stopping at Okoshi-tei and former Tsukuba-san post office which were opened for "Otome-no- Tsukuba-michi". We left the shrine around 17:30, stopped at Fumonji temple and got back to Tsukuba center around 19:30.

Finally, I would like to thank all the participants who made our trip fun.
