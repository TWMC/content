Car and highway transportation around 3000yen to 10000yen / car with ETC depend on route. 
We might get traffic jammed because of the season and this is why the cost is in a big range. The cost include the highway price with ETC and gas for 500km. It'll really depend on the how many cars we're taking and how many people join us. However, we must take a taxi from the finishing point to the car park which will cost about 400 yen per person.
