Description: 

This time we decided to do a little-known trail that is rather more adventurous than other routes up the mountain - it is a lovely quiet ridge walk, but it is a little steep and slippery in places, and there is some scrambling (nothing too difficult or dangerous though). As far as we know, this will be the first time our club has done this trail, and it's not on maps, so it's a good opportunity to explore the mountain.

This will be a car-based hike starting from Yakuo-in temple, so we hope enough car-owners will join too! (TWMC will compensate the drivers of each car used for this hike for petrol etc.)

Meeting place: short-term car park at the bus station in Tsukuba Centre
Time: 8am
Total walking time (without lunch): approx 4 hours
Return time: hopefully back in Tsukuba by 3pm at the latest (to have enough time to get ready for the party)
No membership fee

What to bring:
Walking boots
Rain gear and warm clothing
Water and snacks
Money (to buy lunch on the summit - or bring your own lunch)
