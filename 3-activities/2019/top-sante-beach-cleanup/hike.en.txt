Description: 

Let’s meet at Tsukuba Center at 8:30 am to clean Top Sante Beach on Saturday morning 21 September: International Coastal Cleanup Day.

We will leave the trash bagged and in a pile in the beach parking lot. Hokota City will pick it up from there afterwards. In addition to cleaning, let’s play in the waves and enjoy the beach. After we finish at the beach, we’ll stop at Top Sante Taiyomura Onsen for a relaxing hot spring soak on the way home. This municipal sports/onsen complex website has a nice video of the onsen and beach:  https://topsante-hokota.com/

 

The Ibaraki coast from Hasaki to Mito is long and straight in the north by northeast direction, with concrete jetties every few kilometers. The 52-km drive on local roads from Tsukuba takes about 75 minutes. The sandy beach at Top Sante is suitable and safe for anyone able to walk down the steps from the parking lot, but note that there are no lifeguards and the surf can be dangerous; furthermore, sometimes rip tides develop along the jetties. This beach is popular with surfers and is likely to be busy if surf is up. Waves are not predictable this long in advance, but you can see some relevant information at this site: https://ja.magicseaweed.com/Kashima-Ibaraki-Surf-Report/4014/.

There are no public bathrooms on the beach, but there are public bathrooms up the hill about 300 m in the onsen parking lot.

 

If very bad weather is predicted on the afternoon of the previous day, then I will postpone this event.

 

If you don’t live in Tsukuba but want to participate, you are welcome to meet us at the beach; we should arrive there about 9:45. The will be a car based trip.

To sign up, email me with your name and mobile phone number. If you can drive, then please inform me of how many passengers you can carry.

 

I’ll bring along a cooler, sun shelter, some beach chairs, a kite and some boogie boards.
