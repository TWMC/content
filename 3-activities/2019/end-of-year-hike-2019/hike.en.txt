Description: 

**A lot of people signed up already for this hike, but there is a lack of cars. If you can join and have a car, please write Nobu as soon as possible.**

It's time for our traditional year-end hike up Tsukuba-san and the party at HS!

At least once a year the Tsukukba Walking and Mountaineering Club goes up our 'own' mountain. The end-of-year hike is fun. 

We start walking from the torii at 6-chome and go along the Tsukuba-Michi to get to the Tsukuba-san shrine (20 min), and then head to the summit of Nyotai-san, (female peak).
 However depending on the conditions, we may start from the Tsukuba-san shrine.

Difficulty **
Meeting place: short-term car park at the bus station in Tsukuba Centre
Time: 8:45am
Total walking time (without lunch): approx. 4 hours
Return time: hopefully back in Tsukuba by 4:00pm at the latest (to have enough time to get ready for the party)

*What to bring:
Walking boots
Rain gear, warm clothing and gloves
Water and snacks to share
Money (to buy lunch on the summit - or bring your own lunch)

*No club fee
*500yen will be paid from TWMC for the car owner/driver of each car that takes at least three passengers (besides  the driver).
