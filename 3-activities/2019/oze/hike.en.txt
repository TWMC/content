Description: 

** Thanks to the typhoon Hagibis this hike is canceled **

The wait is over, and here is the announcement for the Oze walk! Oze is one of the most beautiful places; a marshland at a height of 1,500 m surrounded by higher mountains. The main walking option does not require much climbing.

Our accommodation is reserved here at Touden goya
https://www.tokyo-pt.co.jp/oze/mountain-villa/touden
(Yen 9000 with dinner and breakfast)
This hike is open to upto 20 participants. It will be a car based trip, so at least 4 cars will required.  I welcome you all to join this hike!

On the first day we will walk in the beautiful marsh valley to our lodge. 
On next morning there is option to  
(1) climb a mountain Shibutsu-san (800m elevation; from the top there is a gentle path to our departure point)
or (ii) go down to a waterfall and come back
or (3) just walk in the marsh, and reach our departure point..

You can find detailed information about Oze here, in English and Japanese: http://www.oze-fnd.or.jp/

Here are pictures of a former walk in 2014:

We plan to leave Tsukuba at 5:00 am from TX Station to reach the walking point by 10 am. I will write all other details later. The cost of transportation will be shared (highway tolls and gas); the drivers do not need to pay, as usual.

Please let me know if you wish or plan to join as soon as you can. Drivers are especially welcome as this will be a car based trip (with the usual benefits to the drivers/owners).
