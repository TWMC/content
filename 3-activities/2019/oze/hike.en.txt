Description: Oze is a marsh at 1,500m altitude, surrounded by mountains. It is especially beautiful in autumn. This hike is open to upto 20 participants. It will be a car based trip, so at least 4 cars will required. The walking area is mostly flat. On the first day we will walk in the beautiful marsh valley to our lodge.
