Report: 

This is the report of Komachi-yama hike on Jan 13, 2019.

It was about 30min drive from Tsukuba center to the Komachi-yama. We parked our cars at Komachi-no-yakata car parking. However it was already full and took some time to find out the space to park. We finally started walking around 11:15. 

The weather was nice and hiking course was lovely. We reached to the top of Komachi-yama around 12:15. There were many tables and benches around the top. We enjoyed our lunch there and started walking again around 13:00 and got back to the car parking around 14:30. 

The hiking course was well maintained but some places were very steep. The course is easy but it is better wear hiking boots.
Anyway, it was nice and relaxed hike.
