Description: 

This is the first announcement for Ozaku-san hike (石裂山)for 2019/9/14(Saturday). This hike was originally planned last September but it was cancelled due to weather condition. 

I would like to proceed again the day-hike this September because I think it is still worthwhile to introduce many hikers to such a nice local but relatively unknown mountain. 

I put forward the same information regarding this hike again as I did last September. 
Destination: Ozaku-San 
Height: 879.4m
Location: Tochigi-ken,Kanuma-city
Date: 9/14 (Saturday)
Meeting point: Tsukuba TX station car park
Time: 6:30am
Transportation: car 
This is the car-basis trip to Ozaku-San. 
My car allows maximum 4 participants to have a ride,preferably 3 people excluding the driver.....me! 
I appreciate very much if any participant could join with a car if participants are more than 4 people. 


The schedule:
6:30(Tsukuba)—-> (zyoban line)—>(Higashi-kanto line)—> Toga Exit —>route177–>route240–> Kaso-San shrine (the driving time would be around 2h).

Kaso-San shrine —> one of local onsen —>motorway (which route we are taking is dependent on which route is less crowed ...) 
—> Tsukuba (Target time is 20:00..)

The brief information regarding this mountain:

Kaso-San shrine which is laid as the gateway to Ozaku-San was opened up by Syo-do holly priest who pioneered the Nikko shrine in AD782. 

The route to the summit is formed with steep ascend with many chains and metal ladders along the mixture of trees and rocks. But,it is not the same as Myogi-San in terms of difficulty level (easier than M...).

The one of the peaks called Tsuki-Yama is the best spot,where you can see the nice figures of several peaks of Nikko mountains (Nantai,Oku-shirane....).

@@The difficulty level  ## 3/5 ##

The time to complete the route (with return)is roughly estimated around 4h. 
There are some pics on the way to the top as below.

Regarding the weather factor, again the hike will be cancelled in case it is getting wet. The sloppy rocks and wet metal ladders are nothing but very slippery element for this hike. Hopefully we could ascend the peak this time....................

What to bring and what to put on:
Good boats 
Cool clothes (like T shirts)+ warm clothes 
Rain gear
Lunch 
Water 
Gloves (to handle metal chains .....if you need.)
Onsen stuff
