Description: 

I have negotiated a large discount with professional cycling tour guide Brad Bennet (http://freewheeling.jp/adventures/) for a 4-hour tour of Tokyo on Saturday 20 April for a maximum of 10 participants. April is a long way off, but spring is a crowded time in Tokyo and this trip will have limited capacity for this trip. I have tried Brad's tour: it is very fun. 

From Brad’s website:
Celebrating human power and introducing the quiet backstreets, beautiful parks and unique culture of Tokyo not found on tourist maps. Freewheeling was started as a way to help energetic people who appreciate the environment get more out of their experience when staying in Tokyo. We’ve made Tokyo our home for more than 20 years and it's our pleasure to get out on the bikes and share some of our favorite places with you.

 Brad knows many interesting back routes around town and customizes the tours to fit the group. Inform me if you have any particular requests for the types of sites you want to see. Although late April might be too late for cherry blossoms, I imagine that other spring flowers will be prominent at that time.

The tour includes rental bicycles and helmets. The bicycles have baskets in front for light luggage or you can strap a pannier or small bag (bring your own pannier or bungee) onto the rear rack.

The meeting place will be either Tsukuba Station at 8:15 am (to catch the 8:25 Tx rapid) or Sasazuka Station at 9:50.

After the ride we will visit the Devil Craft restaurant in Gotanda from 3 pm. (http://en.devilcraft.jp/about/gotanda/) for delicious deep dish pizza and craft beer, for which I can get a substantial discount. Devil Craft was founded by 3 American homebrewers who very skillfully craft ales in their Tokyo brewery. Here is a third-party review:
