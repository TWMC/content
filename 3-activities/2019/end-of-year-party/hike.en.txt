Description: 

It's time for the TWMC end-of-year party and hike!  

Since the beginning of the club, more than 20 years ago, TWMC has organized an end-of-year party in December. First we go hiking Tsukuba-san, our 'own' mountain and in the evening we gather at Hot Staff.
Bring food, drinks are available from the bar (HS hasn't raised the prices since 20 years, still 500 yen for any drink you'd like).

Everybody is welcome, even people who didn't do any hikes. Come and join us with your friends, family, colleagues, children... It's great to meet friends and just have fun :).

The party is potluck, so please bring something to share with others, if possible, some speciality from your region or country. Don't bring drinks, these will be provided by Hot Stuff (500 yen each). And do bring your own plates and chopsticks so that we don't need to use plastic...

There will no photo competition this year (sorry for all the pictures you purposely took for this event already). 
Nevertheless, there will be a program which is still a ´surprise´ =)
