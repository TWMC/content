Description: 

Kaba-san is located right here in Ibaraki-ken, not so far away from Tsukuba-san.

It will be a relatively easy walk of approximately 4 hours duration, but the path will be rather steep in places. Depending on the number of cars, we either walk back from the Tobacco shrine to Amabiki Kannon (about one hour walk) or leave a car at the Tobacco shrine .

** Car based trip (Amabiki Kannon - Kaba-san - Tobacco shrine) ** 
We start our walk from Rakuhouji Temple, about 2 km north of Kaba-san. The temple, also known as Amabiki Kannon, is regarded as one of the most beautiful temples of the Bandou pilgrimage. The walk will follow a largely well maintained path along the ridge from above Rakuhouji Temple, taking a short detour to the summit of Amabiki-san, go as far as the spectacular craggy peak and shrines of Kaba-san (709 meters), then descend to more shrines at the bottom along the route used by worshipers. One of the shrines is the Tobacco Shrine, featuring the largest pipe in Japan!
