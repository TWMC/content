Description: 

**This hike has been postponed because of the weather forecast.**
New announcement will be made next year.

Hiking Tsukuba in the dark is a different experience, that you shouldn't miss. 
The view from the top of the mountain is gorgeous, enjoy 'Stardust over Tsukuba'.
If the ropeway works we go back by ropeway, but that depends on the weather.
