And let me know if you would like to join..

Other details are in the announcement, copied below.

Until the next/final update with more details,This is announcement of the Family Hike of this year. It will be held on April 14 (Sun) as scheduled. 

As you already know, Family hike is a hike for all abilities! Everyone is recommended to join this walk. You don't necessarily need to come with a family member. But people with children are encouraged to come, as well as with parents, in-laws or friends.

Hokyo-san is nice for a family hike especially because of its proximity and moderate height. It is closer from here than Tsukuba-san, and less than half its height. This year we will take the 'Course 1' route, which has a gentle slope. We will start from the pond, then walk through farms, and up through the forest. We will have lunch at the top.

Where and when to meet: April 14 (Sunday) 8:30 AM at the Tsukuba station short time parking. This parking allows only up to 20 min. of free parking, so be in time.
We should be back by 16:00 in the afternoon.

Clothing according to weather, and rain protection (in case).
Walking or hiking shoes.
What to bring: a lunch box and drinks (water/ juice/ cha).

Fees: Children and drivers are exempt from club fee of 300 yen.

Let me know if you are coming by car.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!

Inform anyone else who may be interested, especially with children.

In case of bad weather, I may postpone to the next week or next month.
waiting to hear from you,
