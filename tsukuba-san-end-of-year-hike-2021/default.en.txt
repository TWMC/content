*Details of the hike

We will climb the north side of the mountain, starting from Tsukushiko. Passing by the Yakuo-in temple, we will walk along quiet paths away from the crowds.
The walk is relatively easy, but more strenuous than the usual routes from the main shrine.
Walking time will be approximately 4 hours (not including breaks). We will probably be back in Tsuksuba around of before 16:00.

On the way down, there are quite a number of steps, so bring walking sticks if you donâ€™t want to ruin your knees.
